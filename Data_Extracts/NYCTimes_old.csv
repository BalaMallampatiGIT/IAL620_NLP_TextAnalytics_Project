1,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/us/politics/manchin-democrats-means-testing.html,Benefits for All or Just the Needy? Manchin’s Demand Focuses Debate - The New York Times,"Oct. 8, 2021Updated 6:26 p.m. ET","Advertisement Supported by As Democrats ponder cutting a $3.5 trillion social safety net bill down to perhaps $2 trillion, a proposal to limit programs to the poor has rekindled a debate on the meaning of government itself. By Jonathan Weisman and Emily Cochrane WASHINGTON — Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia has a ready retort to fellow Democrats who say shrinking the party’s social safety net bill will mean depriving vulnerable populations of critical resources: Limit access to every program in the ambitious measure to only those Americans who need it most. But Mr. Manchin’s idea holds little appeal for Democrats like Representative Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy helicopter pilot and mother of four whose largely upper middle-class district in New Jersey voted narrowly for Donald J. Trump in 2016, then sent her to the House in 2018 after 34 years of Republican representation. Last month, Ms. Sherrill successfully amended the House’s version of the Build Back Better Act to do the opposite of what Mr. Manchin is demanding on a centerpiece of the bill: a child care subsidy to help parents get back to work in a pandemic-ravaged economy. In the original plan, more than $200 billion in child care benefits were limited to families making up to 200 percent of a state’s median income. Ms. Sherrill made the benefit almost universal. “For my constituents, building a generational new system of affordable child care that will finally help working parents enter the work force, and then excluding them from it will represent a severe blow to their faith in the federal government,” she said. “New Jersey already pays more than $10 billion in taxes than we receive in federal spending,” Ms. Sherrill added, “and I will not let another federal program pay less to New Jersey tax payers than it does to all other Americans.” Her position reflects the dilemma Democrats face as they contemplate shrinking 10 years and $3.5 trillion of climate and social safety net programs into a likely size of around $2 trillion. At heart, as they work to unite around President Biden’s signature domestic policy package, Democrats are debating the meaning of government itself, and which citizens should benefit from the taxes almost all of them pay. They are also clashing over how best to get Americans to embrace an expansion of the safety net. With Republicans routinely bashing them as the party of the rich, Democrats may have a hard time defending a plan that lavishes benefits on the leafy suburbs of Montclair and Chatham, N.J. But they also know that the most popular government programs — and the most stable ones — have been those broadly enjoyed, even by the upper reaches of the middle class, such as Social Security and Medicare. Liberal Democrats, as well as some from politically competitive districts like Ms. Sherrill’s, argue that the bill’s benefits should be available to everyone. That would mean fewer programs — but more comprehensive ones. “We don’t ask parents, when they send a child to first grade, how much money they make. We say bring that child in, and we’re going to do the best we can to give her a first-rate education,” Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said. She added, “We build roads and bridges without asking who should be allowed to ride on them. We say everyone rides, because it makes us all better off.” Mr. Manchin and some other conservative-leaning Democrats whose support could prove pivotal in passing the bill say that with federal spending already at unsustainable levels, something has to give, and federal programs like Medicaid, food stamps and welfare have been “means tested” for a half a century. “I think we should still be a compassionate, rewarding society,” Mr. Manchin said on Wednesday, then added, “but compassion means taking care of those who can’t take care of themselves, whether they’re young, whether they have some type of a challenge in life, whether it be mental or physical. Those are the responsibilities that we have.” In a private memo outlining Mr. Manchin’s stance on the multitrillion-dollar package, he called for any new spending related to “families and health” to be “needs-based with means-testing guardrails.” His position could curtail efforts to expand Medicare to include dental, vision and hearing care, to expand universal public school to prekindergarten and two years of community college, and to make federally paid family and medical leave available even to employees of companies that already provide paid leave. His goal, Mr. Manchin later said, was to avoid “basically changing our whole society to an entitlement mentality.” Mr. Manchin’s language has inflamed tensions within the Democratic caucus. Senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, declared: “I believe that seniors having teeth in their mouth, or children having child care is not entitlement. It’s justice.” Some Democrats worry the approach would dull the bill’s overall impact on poverty and income inequality. As with Medicaid and welfare, which is formally called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, rules that make the application process more complex and deliberate efforts by some states to inhibit enrollment would inevitably mean that some of the most needy would miss out. A recent study by the Urban Institute found that the percentage of children who were eligible for government health insurance but were not enrolled had increased in recent years, in part because of the complexity of those programs and a failure to reach out to needy families. Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said the expanded child tax credit, which was temporarily expanded this year as part of a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief measure, had already helped reduce child poverty across the country. “Why would we pull the rug out from under that?” he asked. “Finally, the U.S. government is coming down on the side of fighting poverty.” But Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said Congress needed to be open to income cutoffs and other limitations for at least some programs. “In the same way that we have higher tax rate on people who make more, I think some programs should phase out on people who make more,” he said. Still, lawmakers need to be mindful of complexity, Mr. Kaine cautioned, and some programs are more conducive to such limits than others. For example, the push for universal prekindergarten and community college access should be treated as an extension of the public school system, which is open to all comers, Mr. Kaine said. Representative Jared Golden, a conservative-leaning Democrat from Maine, has also called for targeting some of the plan’s benefits “to those most in need.” In a recent opinion essay in The Portland Press Herald, he wrote that if his party wanted to earn his vote on their sprawling bill, it should be willing to curtail some policies such as the expanded child tax credit and a new tax credit for the purchase of electric vehicles. A half-century of targeting social programs has taught policy experts the best, and worst, ways to devise means tests. The child tax credit, for instance, started as a middle-class benefit that did little for the poor, since it was a refund on earned income. But over time, it expanded downward and upward, to become a cash benefit for families earning little if any wages and an assist for some married couples earning more than $400,000. And because it is administered through the tax code, claiming the benefit is easy. “In principle, means-testing makes an inordinate amount of sense. You’re targeting resources to the people who need it most,” said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group. She added, “While that complexity does add more bureaucracy and room for gaming, it leads to significant savings.” Restricting access to a program does not mean it would stay limited. The Affordable Care Act’s initial unpopularity stemmed in part from the limits of its reach. Middle-class Americans seeking health insurance on the law’s marketplaces found few subsidies and expensive policies. But a temporary expansion in the pandemic relief bill passed this year pushed those subsidies toward the median American family. Now, the Congressional Budget Office estimated, a 64-year-old earning $58,000 and shopping on an Obamacare exchange would see monthly payments decline from $1,075 to $412 because the federal government would take up much of the cost. In a private meeting with Mr. Biden and nearly a dozen House Democrats in swing-districts on Tuesday, the prospect of limiting who could benefit from a promised two years of free community college came up as part of a broader discussion about the program, according to Representative Susan Wild, Democrat of Pennsylvania. But, she added, “the general sentiment was, we should not be putting means-testing in on universal child care, or let’s call it universal preschool.” “It’s completely out of the child’s control, obviously, and, it’s an unfair impediment,” she said. The politics of the debate are murky. Republicans relish attacking Democrats for showering benefits on the rich. They caricature tax credits meant to transition the nation to electric vehicles as subsidies for Tesla owners and mock federally paid family and medical leave by singling out executives who already receive the benefit from their companies. The children of millionaires, they warn, will be among those going to community college for free. “The Democrat party has become the party of the wealthy and affluent,” Representative Jason Smith of Missouri, the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, wrote in an essay for The Washington Examiner published on Tuesday. Many of the charges are exaggerated. Millionaires’ children may not be flocking to community college, free or not. Ms. Sherrill’s amendment lifted the income cap on the child care tax assistance, but the benefit is still set up to limit child care costs to no more than 7 percent of a family’s spending. For truly affluent families, child care is a much smaller percentage than that, so subsidies would still be limited. A million-dollar wealth cap still applies to the program as well. And as Republicans argue the spending helps the rich, they decry tax increases clearly aimed at the rich. Still the charges could sting. “There are programs where I say, if the government is helping out somebody like me, that money is probably coming away from somebody who needs it a lot more,” Mr. Kaine said.

2,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/climate/arizona-senator-sinema.html,"Kyrsten Sinema Wants to Cut $100 Billion in Proposed Climate Funds, Sources Say - The New York Times","Oct. 8, 2021Updated 7:44 p.m. ET","Advertisement Supported by The Arizona senator, who started in politics as an environmentalist, is one of two centrist Democrats who could make or break a spending bill at the center of President Biden’s legislative agenda. By Coral Davenport WASHINGTON — Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who began her political career with the Green Party and who has voiced alarm over the warming planet, wants to cut at least $100 billion from climate programs in major legislation pending on Capitol Hill, according to two people familiar with the matter. Sinema is one of two centrist Democrats in the Senate whose votes are crucial to passing two bills that together would comprise President Biden’s legislative agenda: a $1 trillion infrastructure bill and a separate $3.5 trillion budget bill. Last month, Ms. Sinema told The Arizona Republic, “We know that a changing climate costs Arizonans. And right now, we have the opportunity to pass smart policies to address it — looking forward to that.” In her 2018 run for the Senate, Ms. Sinema was endorsed by the League of Conservation Voters. And she has expressed an interest in using the spending bill to enact a tax or fee on carbon dioxide pollution, which experts say could be among the most effective ways to mitigate global warming. But Ms. Sinema’s demand to cut spending on climate provisions in the budget bill could force Democrats to cut or shrink programs designed to help poor communities adapt to climate change as well as to help companies adjust as the economy transitions away from fossil fuels to clean energy. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted in a letter to colleagues this week that the climate programs would remain. “The climate crisis is a health issue, jobs issue, national security issue and a moral issue to pass the planet on to future generations in a responsible way,” Ms. Pelosi wrote. “This challenge must be addressed with justice for vulnerable communities, who have been hit first and hardest by the climate crisis.” A spokesman for Ms. Sinema, John LaBombard, forcefully denied that Ms. Sinema requested the cuts. “Neither Senator Sinema nor our office have requested or demanded such cuts, nor have we even heard of any such demands,” he wrote in an email. The people familiar with her request, who asked to speak anonymously because they were not authorized to speak on the record, said that she had asked for a cut to the climate program as part of a larger effort by Democrats to hunt for ways to lower the price tag of the broader spending legislation. Mr. Biden had initially envisioned a spending package of about $3.5 trillion, but Democrats are now trying to cut that to $2 trillion, in order to win support from Ms. Sinema and Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, without whose votes the measure will not pass.  As Democrats try to slice $1.5 trillion from the overall bill, party leaders have vowed to protect at least two major climate change programs, which together total about $450 billion. The first, a $150 billion proposal known as the Clean Electricity Program, would reward electric utilities that switch from burning fossil fuels to wind, solar or nuclear power, and penalize companies that don’t. The second is a package of roughly $300 billion in tax incentives to increase the use of wind and solar power and electric vehicles. Those two programs could lead to significant reductions in the nation’s climate-warming pollution and would very likely stand as the most important climate action taken by the United States, analysts said. But to bring down the cost of the bill, and to appease Ms. Sinema, Democrats could still could cut or shrink up to another $200 billion from several other climate programs. “Almost every climate program that’s not those two would be substantially reduced or cut entirely in that circumstance,” said John Coequyt, director of government affairs at the Rocky Mountain Institute, a research organization that focuses on climate change policy. Those could include a number of programs designed to help poor people adapt to the destructive impacts of climate change, as well as $30 billion for a “Green Bank” to help communities finance construction of solar panels and electric vehicle charging stations, and $30 billion to create a “Civilian Climate Corps” that would hire young adults to work in climate mitigation and adaptation, with half coming from communities of color. Another possible contender for the chopping block could be a $10 billion program to help rural electric cooperatives, which supply electricity to over 40 million people in rural communities. The money would aim to ease the price spikes that those rural residents could see in their power bills as the cooperatives make the switch from buying coal-fired power to wind and solar. Other potential cuts could include a $13 billion program to build new electric vehicle charging stations — including $1 billion to ensure that those stations are built in lower-income areas. “Absent programs like that, the economic transition to different energy sources will be less even and equitable,” Mr. Coequyt said. “There will be communities that can’t take advantage of the new technologies for a whole bunch of different reasons.” Cutting assistance to local communities would also undermine popular support for a transition to a clean energy economy, experts say. “Some of the programs that are intended to reach into rural and low-income communities are really important to maintaining the political coalition for this,” said Dallas Burtraw, an analyst for Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan research organization focused on energy and environmental policy. “It could be both an economic and a political problem if those communities are left behind.” Scientists and environmental activists in Arizona say those cuts would end up hurting Ms. Sinema’s constituents. As one of the nation’s hottest and driest states, Arizona is already on the front lines of the extreme weather that scientists say is worsened by a warming planet. Arizona is gripped in a decades-long megadrought, with 95 percent of the state experiencing severe drought conditions. Since 2012, the state has endured five drought events that caused a total of $22.1 billion in damages, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This year alone about half a million acres of the state have been consumed by wildfires, and yet many communities were also flooded by monsoons. Across Arizona, there was a record 522 heat-related deaths in 2020, according to the state. “Annual average temperatures in Arizona have already increased a couple of degrees due to climate change, which may not sound like much, but it has increased heat waves and droughts, it has lowered the snowpack which is essential to our water supply, and which flows in streams that are important to the health of wildlife, which is important to our ranchers and farmers,” said Gregg Garfin, a climatologist at the University of Arizona. Arizona needs federal help to grapple with a hotter climate, he said. “We need the work force,” Mr. Garfin said. “We need the funding. Many communities in Arizona lack the budget or expertise to do this. It requires real money. And it’s super important for Arizona.” Poor and minority communities, which are disproportionately harmed by climate change, must be included in any government plan, said Vianey Olivarria, a director of Chispa Arizona, the state branch of the League of Conservation Voters. “There is no way to have a climate action plan that does not have environmental justice,” she said. Democrats at the forefront of pushing for climate action say none of the policies can be spared. “We cannot slash climate funding in this package. That would go back on the promise to voters, to young people, to the American workers who don’t want to be left behind,” said Senator Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat. “We absolutely need a robust Civilian Climate Corps, which will inspire a new generation of young Americans. We need a robust green climate bank which will unleash for every dollar which is spent, seven to 10 dollars of private sector investment. That’s a very smart way of ensuring that every small city, small town housing authority, small business, can have access to the capital they need to make this transition.” Advertisement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/us/politics/mcconnell-biden-debt-ceiling.html,McConnell Warns Biden He Won’t Help Raise the Debt Ceiling Next Time - The New York Times,"Oct. 8, 2021Updated 7:35 p.m. ET","Advertisement Supported by A day after agreeing to allow a short-term increase in the federal debt limit to move forward, the Republican leader said Democrats should not expect such cooperation in December. By Emily Cochrane WASHINGTON — A day after dropping his party’s blockade and allowing action to temporarily increase the federal debt ceiling, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, warned President Biden on Friday that he had no intention of doing so again, reviving the threat of a first-ever federal default in December. In a phone call with Mr. Biden, Mr. McConnell, who toiled to corral the votes needed to break his own party’s filibuster against the debt limit increase — and voted himself to do so — said Democrats should not expect such help in the future, according to a Senate Republican aide briefed on the conversation. “I will not be a party to any future effort to mitigate the consequences of Democratic mismanagement,” Mr. McConnell wrote in a scathing letter that the aide said restated what he had told the president during the call. “Your lieutenants on Capitol Hill now have the time they claimed they lacked to address the debt ceiling.” The Senate passed a bill on Thursday to lift the statutory limit on federal borrowing by $480 billion, which the Treasury Department said would last until at least Dec. 3. Republicans opposed it en masse, but 11 of them, including Mr. McConnell, broke ranks to provide the 60 votes needed to advance it past a filibuster. The measure is expected to clear the House next week, days before the Oct. 18 deadline when the Treasury Department said the government would no longer be able to borrow to finance its obligations under current law. Mr. McConnell has come under withering criticism from former President Donald J. Trump and some of his Republican colleagues for agreeing to allow the debt limit increase to come to a vote, after insisting for weeks that his party would never do so. He did so under the mounting pressure of a looming government default and as Democrats coalesced around the idea of changing the filibuster rules to allow them to raise the borrowing limit unilaterally. The letter, which the aide said he sent to all Republican senators, appeared intended at least in part to assuage the anger of his colleagues. Mr. McConnell has insisted that Democrats use a complex and arcane budget process known as reconciliation to raise the debt limit, which would shield it from a filibuster and allow it to be passed without any Republican votes. Democrats, who are already using that process to advance a sprawling multitrillion-dollar domestic policy package, have refused, arguing that it would be too time-consuming and cumbersome. The Republican leader argued that by allowing the short-term increase to move forward this week, he was calling Democrats’ bluff, offering them plenty of time to use reconciliation to enact a longer-term solution. But several Republicans balked anyway, and party leaders were forced to spend hours scrounging for the votes. It was an awkward turn for Republicans, who had hoped to use the debt limit drama to score political points against Democrats but ended up bitterly divided themselves. “I don’t understand why we are folding here,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said on Thursday. “This is just a mistake.” Democrats pointed to Mr. McConnell’s move as evidence that Republicans could — and should — at least allow them to raise the debt limit through normal procedures. In a speech on Thursday that angered many Republicans, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, declared victory. “Today’s vote is proof positive that the debt limit can be addressed without going through reconciliation process — just as Democrats have been saying for months,” Mr. Schumer said. “The solution is for Republicans to either join us in raising the debt limit, or stand out of the way and let Democrats address the debt limit ourselves.” Mr. McConnell seized on Mr. Schumer’s comments in his letter, calling it a “partisan, angry and corrosive” speech and yet another reason to withhold Republican votes in the coming months. “This childish behavior only further alienated the Republican members who helped facilitate this short-term patch,” Mr. McConnell wrote. “It has poisoned the well even further.” Advertisement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/business/oecd-global-minimum-tax.html,Global Tax Agreement Will Set 15% Minimum Rate - The New York Times,"Oct. 8, 2021Updated 4:55 p.m. ET","Advertisement Supported by More than 130 countries agreed to set a minimum tax rate of 15 percent as governments look to end a race to the bottom on corporate taxation. By Alan Rappeport and Liz Alderman The world’s most powerful nations agreed on Friday to a sweeping overhaul of international tax rules, with officials backing a 15 percent global minimum tax and other changes aimed at cracking down on tax havens that have drained countries of much-needed revenue. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which has been leading the negotiations, said the new minimum tax rate would apply to companies with annual revenue of more than 750 million euros ($866 million) and would generate around $150 billion in additional global tax revenue per year. “Today’s agreement will make our international tax arrangements fairer and work better,” Mathias Cormann, the organization’s secretary general, said in a statement. “We must now work swiftly and diligently to ensure the effective implementation of this major reform.” The agreement is the culmination of years of fraught negotiations that were revived this year after President Biden took office and renewed the United States’ commitment to multilateralism. Finance ministers have been racing to finalize the agreement, which they hope will reverse a decades-long race to the bottom of corporate tax rates that have encouraged companies to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions, depriving nations of money they need to build new infrastructure and combat global health crises. On Friday, Hungary joined two other important holdouts, Ireland and Estonia, in agreeing to the plan. Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan and Sri Lanka did not sign on to the agreement. The United States, which proposed the 15 percent minimum corporate tax rate, has long looked for ways to minimize incentives for companies to shift profits abroad to lower their tax bills. As the Biden administration prepares to try to raise corporate rates in the United States, getting a global minimum tax in place has become critical to prevent companies from simply moving their headquarters overseas. Republicans, who have opposed Mr. Biden’s domestic tax agenda, immediately objected to the global deal and threatened to block it in Congress, suggesting a looming fight as the United States tries to ratify the agreement. The deal goes beyond setting a global rate — it also creates new rules for the digital era. Under the agreement, technology giants like Amazon, Facebook and other big global businesses will be required to pay taxes in countries where their goods or services are sold, even if they have no physical presence there. The separate tax aimed at the technology giants will reallocate more than $125 billion of profits from the home countries of the 100 most profitable firms in the world to the markets where they operate. Critical details remain to be worked out. The O.E.C.D. statement did not offer a clear timeline for when the existing “digital services taxes” that countries have in place would be rolled back and how the new taxes on large, profitable companies would be divided among countries. Politics could also complicate the administration’s goals. To comply with the new global minimum tax requirements, Congress will have to pass legislation raising the tax that American companies pay on foreign profits to 15 percent, or higher, from 10.5 percent. Democrats expect that they can pass a global tax increase along party lines using a legislative procedure called budget reconciliation. Republicans disagree, and on Friday several Republican senators warned that the administration’s negotiations appeared to “undermine the Senate’s constitutional authority, as well as the United States’ role as a reliable trading partner.” The accord would represent a sea change in the way the world’s largest corporations have been taxed for decades, and is likely to make them pay more taxes while spreading revenue more evenly to countries where those businesses earn sales. Until now, profits have largely been taxed where businesses have had a physical presence. European governments have been pushing for years to even out a global tax system that low-tax countries like Ireland had depended on to lure businesses looking to reduce the taxes they pay. “As of this morning, virtually the entire global economy has decided to end the race to the bottom on corporate taxation,” Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said in a statement. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, called the agreement “historical,” saying in an interview that “we shouldn’t underestimate the political and financial consequences.” “For the first time we’d be in a situation at the world level to avoid tax optimization and tax avoidance,” he said, “and to have a fair amount of taxes paid by digital giants from the United States, China or European Union countries.” The agreement is expected to be finalized next week in Washington by finance ministers of the Group of 20 largest economies, and national leaders are likely to sign off when they meet for a summit in Rome at the end of October. Countries have set a goal of fully activating the agreement by 2023, because it will take time for countries to change their tax laws and for international tax treaties to be updated. European governments are watching anxiously to see whether Mr. Biden can get the legislation passed to ensure that the United States is in compliance. If that happens, France, Britain and other governments have said they will drop taxes that they have been levying on Silicon Valley companies, which nearly touched off a trans-Atlantic trade war. Countries have been debating the timing of the removal of those taxes, with European nations arguing that they should remain in place until the agreement is fully enacted around the world. Mr. Le Maire said France would drop its tax on Amazon, Google and other American digital giants most likely in 2023, after the new tax rules were put in place. France collects just €350 million a year with the tax, which has been a largely a symbolic measure aimed at achieving a broader global deal for digital taxation. Much of corporate America has been wary of the Biden administration’s tax plans, but has been supportive of parts of the global agreement because it would provide some clarity over their tax bills. “Facebook has long called for reform of the global tax rules, and we recognize this could mean paying more tax, and in different places,” said Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice president for global affairs. “We are pleased to see an emerging international consensus.” The sputtering talks gained momentum in May when the United States agreed to accept a minimum tax of at least 15 percent, which was lower than the 21 percent it was hoping to secure. At international forums during the summer, negotiators grappled over potential carve-outs, an implementation period and how the agreement would be enforced once enacted. Among the biggest questions were how the European Union would cajole holdout countries such as Ireland, Estonia and Hungary, whose economic models have been built around low tax rates, to sign on. Without unanimity in the European Union, the agreement could not be enacted. The devastating global economic impact from the coronavirus pandemic was an impetus to get a deal done now, Mr. Le Maire said. Governments see the new tax revenue that they will be able to collect as a vital resource to reduce an inequality divide that worsened during the crisis. “The level of inequality around the world was totally unacceptable, and the best way of reducing the inequalities in a very short lapse of time was to use the taxation tool,” he said. Hungary said it would sign on to the accord after Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has been at odds with the European Union on unrelated rule-of-law issues, held out for better terms to ensure that the nation’s economy wouldn’t lose a competitive edge. Hungary has long offered a 9 percent corporate tax rate to lure investment. It wrested an exemption that would let multinationals reduce profits subject to the minimum tax for a transition period of 10 years, rather than the five years originally proposed. “We have managed to reach a breakthrough on the global minimum tax deal,” the Hungarian finance minister, Mihaly Varga, said. “So Hungary could join the deal with a good heart.” Ireland came around after securing a commitment that its smaller companies, with annual revenue of less than €750 million, would not face the new higher tax. It also persuaded counterparts to drop the words “at least” from a draft of the O.E.C.D. statement, ensuring that the minimum tax would not be ratcheted higher. “I am satisfied that Ireland’s interests are better served within the agreement from my contact and negotiation with international stakeholders in Europe, the United States and beyond,” Paschal Donohoe, Ireland’s finance minister, said in a statement on Thursday. And Estonia announced its backing of the deal on Thursday after resolving concerns that a minimum tax could harm the country’s entrepreneurs.   Jim Tankersley contributed reporting.

5,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/upshot/jobs-report-september.html,"The New Jobs Report Numbers Are Pretty Good, Actually - The New York Times","Oct. 8, 2021Updated 10:25 a.m. ET","Advertisement Supported by They fell far short of analyst expectations, but they reflect a steady expansion that is more rapid than other recent recoveries. By Neil Irwin It’s not as bad as it looks. That’s the most important thing to take away from Friday’s release of the September jobs report, which found that employers added 194,000 jobs last month, a far cry from the 500,000 analysts expected. The initial response among experts was to wonder whether it called for an exclamation of a mere “oof” or a more extreme “ooooooof.” But when you peel apart the details, there is less reason to be concerned than that headline would suggest. The story of the economy in the second half of 2021 remains one of steady expansion that is more rapid than other recent recoveries. It is being held back by supply constraints and, in September at least, the emergence of the Delta variant. But the direction is clear, consistent and positive. Much of the disappointment in payroll growth came from strange statistical quirks around school reopening. The number of jobs in state local education combined with private education fell by 180,000 in September — when the customary seasonal adjustments are applied. There is reason to think the pandemic made those seasonal adjustments misleading. Schools reopened in September en masse, and employed 1.28 million more people (excluding seasonal adjustments) in September than in August. But a “normal” year, whatever that means anymore, would have featured an even bigger surge in employment. In other words, this might be a statistical artifact of a shrinking education sector earlier in the pandemic, not new information about what is happening this fall. Or as the Bureau of Labor Statistics put it in its release, “Recent employment changes are challenging to interpret, as pandemic-related staffing fluctuations in public and private education have distorted the normal seasonal hiring and layoff patterns,” which is the government statistical agency equivalent of a shrug emoji. Another detail in the report that takes some of the sting out of the weak payroll gains was news that July and August numbers were revised up by a combined 169,000 jobs, implying the economy entered the fall in a stronger place than it had seemed. Meanwhile, the focus on the underwhelming job growth numbers has masked what should be viewed as unambiguously good news. The unemployment rate fell to 4.8 percent, from 5.2 percent in August. It fell for good reasons, not bad — the number of people unemployed dropped by a whopping 710,000 while the number of people working rose by a robust 526,000. (These numbers are based on a survey of households, in contrast with the payroll numbers that are based on a survey of businesses; the two diverge from time to time, including this month.) This represents a remarkably speedy recovery in the labor market — attaining sub-5 percent unemployment a mere 17 months after the end of the deepest recession in modern times. By contrast, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the jobless rate did not reach 4.8 percent until January 2016, six and a half years after the technical end of that recession. Part of it is the unusual nature of a pandemic-induced recession and part of it is the highly aggressive response of fiscal policymakers to the crisis. But the result is that jobs are abundant and most people who want to work can. And while participation in the labor force remains well below prepandemic levels and has lots of room for improvement, it is not as bad as it was in that last expansion. In September, for example, the share of people 25 to 54 who were in the labor force — that is, either working or looking for work — was 81.7 percent. That is still well below 83.1 percent before the pandemic, but considerably better than the 81 percent achieved in January 2016, the point in the last expansion when the unemployment rate got this low. Labor force participation remains the Achilles' heel of this recovery. Many Americans who have dropped out of the work force — because of whatever mix of burnout, challenges with child care, or ability to live on pent-up savings or government benefits — are not yet back in action. Notably, even as expanded unemployment insurance benefits expired in early September, there was no surge in participation in the labor force. The labor force participation rate for all adults fell by 0.1 of a percentage point, to 61.6 percent. That suggests that the end of extra-generous job benefits may not be the solution to labor shortage woes that many business groups have argued it would be. Low rates of labor force participation and the weaker-than-expected job growth numbers are most likely two parts of the same story. Businesses want to hire and expand, and labor shortages are real. But there are fewer workers available to be hired right now than there were before the pandemic. That makes for good opportunities for Americans who do want to work. It is reflected in higher pay — average hourly earnings in the private sector were up 4.6 percent in September from a year ago. But it is also acting as a constraint on just how fast this recovery can go.

Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics By Ella Koeze Job growth slowed to the year’s weakest pace last month as the latest coronavirus wave dashed hopes of an imminent return to normal for the U.S. economy. Employers added just 194,000 jobs in September, the Labor Department said Friday, down from 366,000 in August — and far below the increase of more than one million in July, before the highly contagious Delta variant led to a spike in coronavirus cases across much of the country. Leisure and hospitality businesses, a main driver of job growth earlier this year, added fewer than 100,000 jobs for the second straight month. “Employment is slowing when it should be picking up because we’re still on the course set by the virus,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist for the accounting firm Grant Thornton. The economic news is not all gloomy. The unemployment rate fell sharply to 4.8 percent, and wages again rose strongly as companies outside the most Covid-affected industries snapped up available workers, and paid a premium to do so. The government revised its estimate of August job growth upward, and economists said the September figures would have looked stronger had it not been for statistical quirks in measuring public-school hiring.

             Data is seasonally adjusted. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics By Ella Koeze But even the good news came with caveats. The unemployment rate declined in part because fewer people were in the labor force, a sign that the hiring challenges that have bedeviled employers all year won’t be quickly resolved. Rising wages could add to concerns about inflation. And the conflicting signals could complicate decisions for the Biden administration and for the Federal Reserve, which is weighing when to begin pulling back support for the economy. It is possible that the recent slowdown is a Delta-driven blip and will soon fade — or, indeed, may already be largely in the past. The data released on Friday was collected in mid-September, when the Delta wave was near its peak. Since then, cases and hospitalizations have fallen in much of the country, and more timely data from private-sector sources suggests that economic activity has begun to rebound. If those trends continue, people on the sidelines could return to the labor force, and hiring should begin to pick up. “This report is a glance in the rearview mirror,” said Daniel Zhao, an economist at the career site Glassdoor. “There should be some optimism that there should be a reacceleration in October.” But it is also possible that the damage done by the pandemic will take longer to heal than economists had hoped. Supply-chain disruptions have been unexpectedly persistent, and shifts in consumer behavior during the pandemic may not soon reverse. In surveys, many workers say they are reconsidering their priorities and do not want to return to their old ways of working. Policymakers at the Fed are hoping that the Delta disruptions will prove short-lived. Fed officials have signaled that they will soon begin to pull back their support for the economy by slowing their purchase of bonds, something they could announce as soon as November. The September jobs report will probably not derail those plans, which officials have said were based on cumulative job gains and not a single month’s data. The United States has regained more than 17 million jobs since the worst depths of the pandemic. The Biden administration, too, is focused on the longer term. In remarks at the White House on Friday, President Biden highlighted the drop in the unemployment rate and other signs of progress, while conceding he would like to see more rapid job creation in the months ahead. “When you take a step back and look at what’s happening, we are making real progress,” Mr. Biden said. “Maybe it does not seem fast enough. I would like to see it faster, and we’re going to make it faster.” Cumulative change in jobs since before the pandemic, by industry  –1 mil. –2 –3 –4 –5 –6 –7 –8 April Jan. ’21 +74,000 in September 16.9 million jobs in Feb. 2020 –2 –1 mil.

Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics By Ella Koeze One reason for optimism is that the Delta variant’s economic impact, while significant, has been somewhat contained. Construction companies and manufacturers reported strong job growth in September, despite supply-chain difficulties, and retail hiring rebounded after two months of declines. The biggest drag on employment in September was in the public sector. Government payrolls shrank by 123,000 jobs, with most of the losses in education. But economists said that decline probably reflected the way the Labor Department accounts for seasonal patterns, which the pandemic disrupted. On an unadjusted basis, federal, state and local government employment actually grew by close to 900,000 workers in September. Because that’s fewer than in a typical September, the seasonal adjustment formula interprets it as a loss in jobs. But by any measure, job growth has slowed significantly since earlier in the year. And the data released on Friday provided a stark reminder of the power the pandemic still holds over the economy, and of the long road ahead even once it is over. There are five million fewer people on U.S. payrolls than in February 2020, and 2.7 million people have been out of work for six months or more, the standard threshold for long-term unemployment. Yet job openings are at a record high, and many employers report having a hard time filling positions.

             Data is seasonally adjusted. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics By Ella Koeze September was meant to be the month the hiring logjam began to abate. Expanded unemployment benefits, which many businesses blamed for discouraging people from looking for work, ended nationwide early last month. Schools reopened in person in much of the country, which should have made it easier for parents to return to work. Rising vaccination rates were meant to make reluctant workers feel safe enough to resume their job searches. As recently as August, many economists circled September as the month when workers would flood back into the job market. Instead, the labor force shrank by nearly 200,000 people. The pandemic’s resurgence delayed office reopenings, disrupted the start of the school year and made some people reluctant to accept jobs requiring face-to-face interaction. At the same time, preliminary evidence suggests that the cutoff in unemployment benefits has done little to push people back to work.

             Data is seasonally adjusted. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics By Ella Koeze “I am a little bit puzzled, to be honest,” said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist for the investment bank Jefferies. “We all waited for September for this big flurry of hiring on the premise that unemployment benefits and school reopening would bring people back to the labor force. And it just doesn’t seem like we’re seeing that.” Ms. Markowska said more people might begin to look for work as the Delta variant eased and as they depleted savings accumulated earlier in the pandemic. But some people have retired early or have found other ways to make ends meet and may be slow to return to the labor force, if they come back at all. In the meantime, people available to work are enjoying a rare moment of leverage. Average earnings rose 19 cents an hour in September and are up more than $1 an hour over the last year, after a series of strong monthly gains. Pay has risen even faster in some low-wage sectors.

Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics By Ella Koeze Many businesses are finding that higher wages alone aren’t enough to attract workers, said Becky Frankiewicz, president of the Manpower Group, a staffing firm. After years of expecting employees to work whenever they were needed — often with no set schedule and little notice — companies are finding that workers are now setting the terms. “They get to choose when, where and in what duration they’re working,” Ms. Frankiewicz said. “That is a role reversal. That is a structural change in the workers’ economy.” Arizmendi Bakery, a cooperative in San Rafael, Calif., recently raised its wages by $3 an hour, by far the biggest increase in its history. But it is still struggling to attract applicants heading into the crucial holiday season. “There are many, many, many more businesses hiring than there used to be, so we’re competing with many other businesses that we weren’t competing with before,” said Natalie Baddorf, a baker and one of the owners. The bakery has managed to hire a few people, including one who began this week. But other workers have given their notice to leave. The bakery, which has been operating on reduced hours since the pandemic began, now has enough business to return to its original hours, but cannot find enough labor to do so. “We’re talking about cloning ourselves,” Ms. Baddorf said.

Bannon said he was refusing to comply with a subpoena from the committee on the directive of the former president. By Maggie Haberman and Luke Broadwater WASHINGTON — The select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot threatened on Friday to pursue criminal charges against Stephen K. Bannon, the former chief strategist to President Donald J. Trump, for refusing to comply with its subpoena, announcing it would consider initiating contempt of Congress proceedings. In a statement after Mr. Bannon informed the panel that he would not cooperate in the inquiry, the panel’s leaders said they would “swiftly consider” a criminal contempt referral, raising the prospect of what could be a prolonged legal battle over what could be crucial evidence in the investigation. The committee has ordered four former Trump administration officials — Mr. Bannon; Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff; Dan Scavino Jr., a deputy chief of staff; and Kash Patel, a Pentagon chief of staff — to sit for depositions and furnish documents and other materials relevant to its investigation. Mr. Meadows and Mr. Patel have had some communication with the committee, according to the joint statement issued on Friday by Representatives Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and the committee’s chairman, and Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming and the vice chairwoman. Mr. Scavino had not been served the subpoena until Friday, Politico reported. In a letter to the panel on Thursday, Robert Costello, Mr. Bannon’s lawyer, informed the committee that his client would not comply. Mr. Costello said Mr. Bannon was abiding by Mr. Trump’s directive for his former aides and advisers facing subpoenas to invoke immunity and refrain from turning over documents that might be protected under executive privilege. “It is therefore clear to us that since the executive privileges belong to President Trump, and he has, through his counsel, announced his intention to assert those executive privileges enumerated above, we must accept his direction and honor his invocation of executive privilege,” Mr. Costello wrote. In their statement, the leaders of the select committee rejected Mr. Bannon’s rationale for stonewalling their investigation. “While Mr. Meadows and Mr. Patel are, so far, engaging with the select committee, Mr. Bannon has indicated that he will try to hide behind vague references to privileges of the former president,” they said in their joint statement. “The select committee fully expects all of these witnesses to comply with our demands for both documents and deposition testimony.” “We will not allow any witness to defy a lawful subpoena or attempt to run out the clock,” they added. While Mr. Bannon worked at the White House in 2017, he departed in August of that year, and was not an executive branch employee in the lead-up to, or on, Jan. 6. It is not clear how executive privilege — which can shield White House deliberations or documents involving the president from disclosure — would apply to any interactions he may have had with Mr. Trump related to the riot, which occurred more than three years after he left the administration. “Steve Bannon was not in the executive branch and was not working for the president,” said Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland and a member of the committee. “Even if you make the assumption that Donald Trump has even a shred of executive privilege, how could that extend to Steve Bannon?” The Biden administration said on Friday that it would not extend executive privilege, which usually applies to a sitting president, to the former president for the first batch of documents requested by the committee. That means the panel would have access to a wide range of documents it requested from the National Archives. “As part of this process, the president has determined that an assertion of executive privilege is not warranted for the first set of documents from the Trump White House,” Jen Psaki, the White House spokeswoman, said Friday. The development sets up a potential legal battle between Mr. Trump’s claims of executive privilege and the committee, which is scrutinizing efforts by the former president to overturn the results of the 2020 election and any connections he or his administration may have had to the rioters. Mr. Trump said in a statement that he had sent a letter to the National Archives contesting the Biden administration’s stance, and he denounced the committee’s investigation as a “dangerous assault on our Constitution.” Mr. Raskin, who is a constitutional law professor, said executive privilege hinges on whether national security concerns outweigh the need for government transparency. In this case, he said, they are not in conflict. “There is no coup-against-the-government privilege a president can invoke,” he said. “They are trafficking in absurdities.” Mr. Trump’s and Mr. Bannon’s strategies seem clear, Mr. Raskin said: Attempt to slow down the committee’s work long enough to allow Republicans to win control of the House in the 2022 midterm elections, when they could move to dissolve the committee. “The whole game is to drag this out as long as possible, to see whether they can mobilize enough voter suppression to get Congress to change hands,” he said. “We’re not going to let people play games and sweep evidence under the rug.” In a letter reviewed by The New York Times this week, Mr. Trump’s lawyer asked that witnesses not provide testimony or documents related to their “official” duties, and instead invoke any immunities they might have “to the fullest extent permitted by law.” Mr. Costello, the lawyer for Mr. Bannon, wrote in his letter, which was also obtained by The Times, that his client would “comply with the directions of the courts,” but that for now, “Mr. Bannon is legally unable to comply with your subpoena requests for documents and testimony.” It was unclear whether Mr. Bannon was planning to go to court. In a statement, Mr. Patel said he had responded to his subpoena “in a timely manner.” Mr. Trump’s effort to block compliance with the subpoenas is the latest turn in an intensifying campaign among Republicans to rewrite the history of Jan. 6, downplaying or outright denying the violence that took place. That has included efforts to block an independent inquiry, and an aggressive push to discredit the House investigation, as the former president and his allies in Congress increasingly view the attack carried out in Mr. Trump’s name as a horror they would prefer to forget. Mr. Bannon’s refusal to comply with the committee came as the panel issued three more subpoenas on Thursday, targeting organizers of the “Stop the Steal” rally that brought together many of Mr. Trump’s supporters who went on to violently storm the Capitol. The latest subpoenas seek deposition testimony from Ali Abdul Akbar, also known as Ali Alexander, and Nathan Martin, both of whom were involved in organizing protests around the country — including in Washington on Jan. 6 — based on Mr. Trump’s lies that he was the rightful winner of the 2020 election and that it had been riddled with fraud. The committee also issued a subpoena for Stop the Steal L.L.C., an organization affiliated with the event. Mr. Alexander issued a statement in response, saying he was “being targeted because I am a Black patriotic man peacefully agitating an insecure government.” Catie Edmondson contributed reporting.

8,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/us/trump-hotel-washington.html,"Trump Hotel Lost Money, Despite Lobbyist Spending, Documents Show - The New York Times","Oct. 8, 2021Updated 6:50 p.m. ET","Advertisement Supported by House investigators released data revealing that the hotel in Washington lost $74 million from 2016 to 2020, a figure disputed by the Trump Organization. By Eric Lipton WASHINGTON — Despite all the Republican-paid political events and big bar tabs from lobbyists, foreign dignitaries and other supporters of President Donald J. Trump, the Trump International Hotel in Washington lost an estimated $74 million between 2016 and 2020, according to data released on Friday by House investigators. The tally came from Mr. Trump’s own auditors, showing losses that generally increased through his tenure in the White House, even as Mr. Trump’s annual financial disclosure reports showed revenues of more than $40 million a year, at least until the pandemic hit. The new account of revenues and annual losses at the hotel — which is in a federally owned landmark known as the Old Post Office building — was released as House Democrats push the Biden administration to turn over additional documents to determine if Mr. Trump broke federal rules by continuing to operate the hotel through his family while serving as president. “The documents provided by G.S.A. raise new and troubling questions about former President Trump’s lease,” said a letter sent Friday by the House Oversight and Reform Committee to the General Services Administration, asking for more information. The materials released by House investigators estimated that the hotel also generated nearly $3.8 million in revenue from foreign government officials during the first three years Mr. Trump was in office, be it hotel stays or meals or other business. The president drew in foreign dignitaries who often liked to be seen at his hotel, at times even meeting with Mr. Trump’s aides at the complex. Millions more were spent by the Republican National Committee and various election campaigns and other political groups backing Republican candidates, or supporting Mr. Trump’s re-election efforts, Federal Election Commission reports show. During his presidency, the Trump hotel became a showcase of special-interest lobbying and maneuvering by allies of Mr. Trump to draw his attention or support. Still, the overall message was that the Trump International Hotel, despite all the headlines, is a money-losing operation, said David J. Sangree, an accountant who runs a firm, Hotel & Leisure Advisors, that evaluates hotel industry performance and who looked at the audited reports at the request of The New York Times. “You would expect a hotel in Washington, D.C., to earn a profit,” he said. The Trump family often has various ways of counting revenues and losses, for example presenting one set of figures suggesting losses to property tax authorities in an effort to reduce tax bills and giving another to the public that suggests higher returns reflecting well on Mr. Trump’s business acumen. Prosecutors in New York are already investigating whether Mr. Trump essentially keeps two separate sets of books: one with glowing numbers that banks and insurers received and another bleaker set of data for tax collectors. Eric Trump, who has helped run the family business since his father started his campaign for president, called the $74 million tally of losses at the hotel between 2016 and 2020 “total nonsense,” since it includes a common accounting exercise that cuts actual business profits by considering the annual depreciation of the value of the property. The revenues collected from foreign government sources, Eric Trump added, would have been much higher if the Trump family had actively worked to solicit this business. Instead, the company attempted during most of the time Mr. Trump was in office to discourage it, he said. The Trump family made annual payments to the Treasury for the Trump hotel in Washington — totaling $355,687 between 2017 and 2019 — to attempt to return profits from these sales to foreign government officials. The payments from foreign governments led to accusations in court cases that Mr. Trump was in violation of the so-called emoluments clause of the Constitution, which seeks to bar federal officials from receiving payments from foreign governments. Eric Trump also disputed a suggestion by the House Oversight Committee that the Trump family had received preferential treatment from Deutsche Bank, which financed the renovation of the Old Post Office building before it reopened as a hotel. The committee questioned why the terms of loan were changed to interest-only payments in 2018, but Eric Trump said the relatively high assessed value of the hotel allowed the company to defer principal payments on the $170 million loan for several years. “They have written a narrative that is purposely false,” Eric Trump said in an interview Friday. “And they know it is false.” Former President Trump had filed annual public reports, as required under the law, providing only gross revenues from the hotel, not profits. The information released on Friday includes profitability figures calculated in a number of ways. Detailed financial reports prepared by Mr. Trump’s auditors, which were also released by the House on Friday, show a total loss of $74 million by including depreciation in the value of the hotel of about $8 million a year. But even taking out the losses from depreciation, the documents still show that year after year, once taxes, lease payments and rent paid to the federal government are factored in, the hotel still lost money. It just lost less by that standard than by the one highlighted by House Democrats on Friday. For example, the statement of operations as of August 2018 showed that the losses for the prior year were about $5.3 million, once depreciation was removed, compared with the $13.5 million loss for that year that the House committee said occurred. Losses in 2019, by this adjusted calculation, would have been $9.6 million, compared with the $17.8 million that the House Democrats cited. Mr. Sangree said the net income at the Trump hotel in Washington, even after depreciation and interest on the loan is removed from the calculation, is relatively poor compared with other luxury hotels in major cities. The financial reports released by House investigators provide once-confidential details on the operation of the hotel, showing that it earned an unusually high share of its revenues from its restaurant and bar, compared to its hotel rooms. Each category brought in about $25 million in 2018. Typically, room revenues are considerably larger than meals and bar service, Mr. Sangree said. But large crowds of lobbyists and friends of Mr. Trump’s gathered almost every night in the Trump hotel lobby while he was president, and were sometimes even greeted by Mr. Trump himself as he arrived at the hotel to have dinner at its steakhouse. Some allies of Mr. Trump were such frequent patrons of the hotel bar, like Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and personal lawyer to Mr. Trump, that they had tables they considered their own. Still, the hotel would most likely post much higher profits under a different owner, Mr. Sangree said, because it would no longer be hard to sell to major corporations that have stayed away because of controversies related to Mr. Trump. Management costs at the hotel have also been abnormally high, he said, as a share of revenues. “This hotel should be doing better,” Mr. Sangree said, noting that the documents released Friday showed an average daily room rate of about $500, which should be high enough to produce considerable profit. The Trump family has moved twice in recent years to sell the lease it has with the federal government to operate a hotel at the site. Offers are still being considered, after about a dozen bids came in for the property, including from several major national hotel brands, one executive involved in the negotiations said. With Mr. Trump out of office, the hotel is now much less of a draw among prominent Republican players in Washington. Its lobby now often sits largely empty, as the search for a potential buyer of the lease continues.

They and their families enjoy privileges and opportunities that most of us can only imagine. Yet they were willing to break the law, and the jury has now found that they did break the law in order to guarantee an admission spot for their children in the school of their choosing. What they did was an affront to hard-working students and parents. But the verdict today proves that even these defendants, powerful and privileged people are not above the law. By Anemona Hartocollis Two parents were found guilty in federal court in Boston on Friday for participating in a bribery scheme to have their children fraudulently admitted as athletic recruits to some of the most prestigious universities in the country. Gamal Abdelaziz, a former casino executive, and John Wilson, a private equity financier, were the first people to stand trial in the federal investigation known as Operation Varsity Blues. The investigation has snared more than 50 parents, coaches, exam administrators and others in an admissions scheme that implicated college athletic programs at the University of Southern California, Yale, Stanford, Wake Forest and Georgetown. Many other wealthy parents, including some celebrities, have pleaded guilty rather than take their chances in court. Mr. Abdelaziz, 64, was accused of paying $300,000 in 2018 to have his daughter admitted to U.S.C. as a top-ranked basketball recruit even though she did not make the varsity team in high school. Mr. Wilson, 62, was accused of paying $220,000 in 2014 to have his son admitted as a water polo recruit at U.S.C. His son did play water polo, but prosecutors said he was not good enough to compete at the university. Mr. Wilson was also accused of agreeing to pay $1.5 million in 2018 to have his twin daughters, who were good students, admitted to Harvard and Stanford as recruited athletes. “What they did was an affront to hard-working students and parents,” Nathaniel R. Mendell, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said in a news conference after the verdict. “But the verdict today proves that even these defendants, powerful and privileged people, are not above the law.” Mr. Abdelaziz and Mr. Wilson were both convicted on charges of conspiracy to commit bribery and fraud; Mr. Wilson alone was found guilty of additional fraud and bribery charges and of filing a false tax return for taking a deduction for a payment that the government called a bribe. They face up to 20 years in prison on the most serious charges. But experts said that under the sentencing guidelines they would get far less, perhaps less than three years for Mr. Abdelaziz and less than five years for Mr. Wilson. In many ways, the college admissions system was also on trial. The defense argued that its clients were playing by the rules as they understood them: that wealthy parents could get an edge for their children by donating money. In this case, they paid the money through a corrupt college consultant, William Singer, who said he had a “side door” reserved for recruited athletes. Mr. Singer’s scheme has thrown an unflattering light on the college coaching industry, in which parents pay thousands of dollars for tutoring and advising services to help their children get into prestigious institutions. And it showed how many students use college athletics to gain a big advantage in admissions, reinforcing a cynical view that gaining entry into highly selective schools can be a transactional process. But prosecutors stressed that universities were not on trial, and that this was not a case about traditional admissions. The defendants, they said, had gone to great lengths to pay bribes and falsify their children’s athletic profiles. Even so, the case could lead to some self-examination by admissions officials, said Jeffrey M. Cohen, a former federal prosecutor and associate professor at Boston College Law School. “People who are trying to cheat always look for the weakest link,” Mr. Cohen said, adding, “What’s shocking about this case was that we saw in broad daylight that people were lying to get through these weak links in the admissions system.” U.S.C. issued a statement saying, “We respect the judicial process and the jury’s decision.” The verdict was a swift, resounding victory for the prosecution. The jury came into the courtroom a little after 2:30 p.m. Friday, just more than 24 hours after it began deliberating. The court clerk read the verdict form, pronouncing each man’s name and a separate “guilty” verdict, over and over again, five times for the charges they had in common, and another six times for Mr. Wilson, a crushing pile of guiltys. “This is obviously not the result he was looking for, but you know that’s our system and that’s why they have appellate courts, so that’s what we’ll be doing next,” Mr. Abdelaziz’ lawyer, Brian Kelly, said outside the courthouse. As Mr. Wilson walked calmly out of John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse, he kept a straight face and held his wife’s hand. Though he was met by a barrage of reporters, he did not answer any questions. Since the indictments were announced in March 2019, 47 of the 57 defendants who have been charged have pleaded guilty or have agreed to do so. Thirty-three of those have been parents, including the actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, and Ms. Loughlin’s husband, Mossimo Giannulli, a fashion designer. Their sentences have ranged up to nine months in prison. A handful of parents are scheduled to go on trial in the new year. The linchpin of the operation was Mr. Singer, who billed himself as a “concierge” admissions consultant for wealthy families. He ran a company called the Key and an associated foundation that provided a mix of legitimate and fraudulent services, and worked with a network of athletic coaches and administrators. He has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges and is cooperating with the government, though he has not yet been sentenced. Prosecutors said Mr. Singer’s services appealed to parents who wanted a guarantee of admission; he typically told them they did not have to pay in full until their children were admitted. “The parents did not come up with the scheme; that was Rick Singer,” Leslie Wright, one of the prosecutors, said. “But without them, it never would have happened.” After his son was admitted to U.S.C. as a water polo recruit, Mr. Wilson wrote in a March 2014 email to Mr. Singer: “Thanks again for making this happen! Pls give me the invoice. What are the options for the payment?” He asked if Mr. Singer could make it “for consulting or whatever,” so that “I can pay it from the corporate account?” The defense argued that Mr. Wilson, a former Gap and Staples executive, and Mr. Abdelaziz, a former Wynn Resorts executive, were the victims of a masterful con artist. Mr. Singer had earned their trust by providing years of college coaching services, the defense lawyers told the jury, and they had no reason to suspect him. They said they never saw the emails containing phony athletic profiles of their children that Mr. Singer sent to them for their approval — a claim the prosecution said was unlikely. “John is not part of Singer’s con,” Michael Kendall, Mr. Wilson’s lawyer, told the jury. “There is no evidence, not even a hint, that John figured out Singer’s scam.” Mr. Kelly, Mr. Abdelaziz’ lawyer, said: “It’s not illegal to do fund-raising, not illegal to give money to a school in the hopes that your kid will get in. So that’s his mind-set.” In the end, the jurors did not see the defense’s blurry line, but a clear one. And they found that it had been crossed. “The defendants in the case decided today were powerful and successful men,” Mr. Mendell, the acting U.S. attorney, said. “They and their families enjoyed privileges and opportunities that most of us could only imagine, yet they were willing to break the law. And a jury has now found that they did break the law.” Colleen Cronin contributed reporting from Boston.

It was a California fantasy. Over six colorful pages the brochure sold buyers on an indoor-outdoor lifestyle where the living room opened to a yard and children played behind a redwood fence. The fairy tale ended with the map to an address on Clairemont Drive. That’s where a row of model houses sat bunched up on a corner, waiting to be walked through. “More luxury at lower cost.” The pitch rolled across the cover of a brochure that introduced thousands of aspiring homeowners to Clairemont Villas, a San Diego subdivision that promised new homes in a world without trade-offs. “Private and protected.” “Beauty and convenience.” A single-family house in a quiet suburb — but just a few minutes’ drive from new schools and a new shopping center along with downtown and the beach.

The fairy tale ended with the map to an address on Clairemont Drive. That’s where a row of model houses sat bunched up on a corner, waiting to be walked through. By Conor Dougherty Sixty-five years later, Margie Coats, 79, still remembers the tour. Her father drove the six of them — two parents, four sisters — to a weekend showing where in her teenage naïveté she asked a salesperson if the furniture was included. The family paid $13,250 for Lot 118 and a year later moved into 5120 Baxter Street. This was in 1957, back when the surrounding Clairemont neighborhood was booming with new subdivisions and mass-produced suburbs were still a national experiment. Neighbors in Clairemont Villas picked from a selection of four Craftsman houses that had the same cabinets, similar floor plans and an option to add a washing machine. (Clothes still had to be dried on a line.) Most of the residents were young families with parents who worked a mix of trade and professional jobs that had roughly the same paychecks. Ms. Coats’s father, Paul Shannon, was an aeronautical engineer who had left the Navy to work in private defense. This afforded them the relative affluence of a four-bedroom house with a yard that was bigger than any of their neighbors’. It became the block’s social center. “That was where everybody congregated on the weekends,” Ms. Coats said. “People would pitch in: Somebody would bring beer, somebody would bring hamburgers, somebody would bring hot dogs, and we would just all gather.” Ms. Coats has not ventured far since: She moved about 40 feet away and has spent almost her entire adult life living across the street from her childhood home. Her former yard is the first thing she sees whenever she leaves the house, a view that allowed her to follow the daily progress of a construction project that over the past few months transformed 5120 Baxter from the suburban vision of the 1950s to a projection of California’s tighter, taller future. In June, as Ms. Coats told me about the house and the neighborhood from the doorstep of her bungalow, she gazed toward a fresh foundation that had entombed the back half of Lot 118 in concrete. Over the next few weeks, a construction crew erected a two-story building that filled in a green rectangle from the Clairemont Villas brochure. A few feet away, the original four-bedroom house was loudly gut-renovated into a pair of apartments. When the workers head to their next job this month, they will leave what amounts to a triplex rental complex on the type of lot that in the seven decades since Ms. Coats’s family moved in had been reserved for single-family houses. It’s part of a push across California and the nation to encourage density in suburban neighborhoods by allowing people to subdivide single-family houses and build new units in their backyards. Dan Logue, 60, a teacher who lives on Baxter Street, said he was excited about the project, and backyard houses generally, because they allowed homeowners to develop their own land. (“Neighborhoods change as people die off, and that’s just reality.”) Ms. Coats was so-so. She said she was worried about less parking but also about San Diego's housing problem and hoped the new units would do some good. (“I’m not going to go down to the City Council and beat my head against the wall and say, ‘No, no, no.’”) Cary Gross, 63, who owns a tile company and lives next to Ms. Coats, is against it. He invested on a single-family block 25 years ago with the expectation that it would stay that way. “They say they’re doing this so everyone can have the American dream,” he said. “But what about the American dream of living in a single-family neighborhood?” The house at 5120 Baxter Street has been home to three families and contains any number of stories. The one I’m going to tell you is about the house’s place in California’s spiraling affordable housing crisis and the state’s efforts to halt it. The suburban dream that Ms. Coats’s family bought into has become the American housing system. Reforming it is key to any number of existential problems, including reducing segregation and wealth inequality or combating sprawl and climate change (transportation accounts for about a third of the nation’s carbon dioxide emissions). But the process will be long and difficult, as single-family neighborhoods are America’s predominant form of living and homeowners broadly enjoy them. The implications go way beyond geography. The America that prevailed when Ms. Coats’s family of six moved to Baxter Street was a more middle-class country, where women had about 3.5 children on average. Today inequality is much starker, and the fertility rate has been cut in half as adults remain single longer and have fewer or no children after they pair up. Members of the millennial generation continue to lag their parents in homeownership, and 20 percent of U.S. households are multigenerational — up from 12 percent in 1980 — as families grapple with the cost of living. In other words, the pressure to remake neighborhoods like Clairemont is due not to some sudden shift in what people want out of a home but rather to the sweeping social changes that have already played out inside them. As the Columbia University historian Kenneth Jackson wrote in “Crabgrass Frontier,” his seminal history of America’s suburbs: “No society can be fully understood apart from the residences of its members.” When Ms. Coats moved into the Baxter Street house, a family needed right around the area’s median income to afford the $82 monthly mortgage payment — the definition of middle class. Today a typical Clairemont home costs $850,000, up 30 percent from 2019. A family would need to make about double San Diego’s median income to afford one, according to Redfin, the real estate brokerage. And it wouldn’t be a new place. That inflation all but defined the lives of the Reece family, which moved into 5120 Baxter a decade after the Coats family moved out and stayed there until last year. John Reece was a retired master chief petty officer in the Navy who spent five years saving for a down payment by living in a trailer park with his wife, Barbara, and baby daughter, Patricia. The Reeces entered the house in 1976 as renters and bought it two years later. Patricia Reece would spend most of her adult life struggling to leave for a home of her own. She moved into and out of Baxter Street several times while she raised kids and completed college. In 1993, the year a house down the block from Baxter Street sold for $117,000, she and her husband at the time moved to Pennsylvania with a plan to emulate her parents’ strategy of saving money in a trailer. (“We were like, ‘Hey, my parents started in a trailer — we can get our trailer and make this happen.’”) When they returned two years later, the same house was on the market for $168,000, Ms. Reece said. California home prices have only risen since, resulting in a worst-in-the-nation affordable housing crisis. Juxtaposed against large numbers (a median price over $800,000) and zany stories (sales $1 million above the asking price) are the scenes of abject misery that unfold in the daily lives of the 100,000 souls who live along its freeways and streets. The root of all this is a decades-old housing shortage. Since the mid-1970s, when home prices began outpacing wages, planners and economists have argued that California’s housing problems will persist as long as it remains one of the hardest places in America to build shelter. Nevertheless, city councils and the State Legislature more or less ignored this advice until a few years ago. Faced with ballooning home costs that even a pandemic couldn’t tame, politicians from both parties now routinely talk about the state’s and nation’s affordability problems in terms of a lack of homes. The debate is about where and how to build new ones.

Sources: California Department of Housing and Community Development, SanGIS By Ella Koeze Across America, housing is for the most part built in one of two familiar ways. The first is when acres of fields outside the urban center are turned into wide streets and cul-de-sacs named after trees. The second is when a developer descends on an already urbanized neighborhood and, after donating to a few campaigns and feuding with anti-gentrification activists, builds a glass condominium tower or high-rent apartment building. In the vast zone between those poles lie existing single-family neighborhoods like Clairemont, which account for most of the urban landscape yet remain conspicuously untouched. The omission is the product of a political bargain that says sprawl can sprawl and downtowns can rise but single-family neighborhoods are sealed off from growth by the cudgel of zoning rules that dictate what can be built where. The deal is almost never stated so plainly, but it is the foundation of local politics in virtually every U.S. city and cuts to the core of the country’s deepest class and racial conflicts. And now it’s being torn up. The loudest rip came last month when, two days after surviving a California recall election, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 9. By legalizing duplexes statewide and allowing people to subdivide single-family lots, S.B. 9 effectively ended single-family zoning in a state of 40 million whose identity is predicated on the suburban idyll. But that was just the latest in a yearslong effort — one mirroring efforts around the country — that ushered in dozens of state housing laws that streamline construction of backyard units, require cities to plan for higher-density development and strip them of power if they fail to comply. When you add S.B. 9 to earlier rules for backyard units, California has paved the way for some 2.5 million new housing units — about 25 years’ worth at the state’s current pace of building — in existing single-family neighborhoods, according to an analysis by the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley. “These laws have opened up entire communities that had been largely walled off,” said Ben Metcalf, managing director of the Terner Center. “Even if it starts slow, we are solidly on a path to a very different California.” Clairemont is at the center of this retrofit. The neighborhood is a classic post-World War II suburb built around curved streets and strip malls. In the ’50s it was promoted as a hamlet outside the bustle. Now it is centrally located, between downtown San Diego to the south and the northward cluster of biotechnology companies expanding around the University of California, San Diego. The city is recasting the area as a transit hub where people live closer together and commute via a $2.1 billion expansion of the San Diego Trolley. John Reece was 82 and stricken with Parkinson’s disease when the California Legislature began its housing push in 2016. Patricia Reece was in her 40s with three children and had returned to Baxter Street once again, this time from Missouri, where she had finally bought a home but was foreclosed on during the financial crisis. She had a doctorate and was working as a psychologist, but saving for a down payment in San Diego still felt like an exercise in futility. What would they do when Mr. Reece passed on? The question lingered in the background until 2019, when the inevitable happened and Ms. Reece inherited the property. Low on savings and heavy on student loans, she did what middle-class Californians do when they want a bigger home and need to pay down debt: She sold her parents’ house and moved to Texas. “I could get money underneath my belt so that my kids could get their educations underneath their belts,” Ms. Reece said. “In California, we couldn’t do it.” A year later, 5120 Baxter passed to a limited liability company operated by Christian Spicer, a longtime home-flipper looking to get in on the backyard boom. Christian Spicer, 34, began his real estate career in the throes of the Great Recession, when millions of families were being foreclosed on and investors were buying homes on courthouse steps. He was the guy who showed up at people’s doors to tell them, in the nicest way possible, that their property belonged to someone else and that they had to work out a rental agreement or find another place to live. Mr. Spicer is a mellow presence who speaks in a voice that could get him cast in a movie about people who like to get high and surf (“I’m definitely on the chill vibe of things”). But he is also 6-foot-3 and 250 pounds. The home buyers he worked for during the recession thought this made him a good candidate for house calls — in case anyone got mad, which of course people often did. Most of the time this manifested in a profane version of the words “screw you,” but once someone stabbed him in the arm with a pen. He went to his next appointment in a bloody shirt. “It didn’t feel great,” Mr. Spicer said of the job. “The fun part was now I got to go in and turn the unit. I got to decide the color of the cabinets and clean it up, put the flooring in, and I’d have this product I was proud to go and lease.” His professional life has ever since been dictated by a cold calculation of which sorts of properties are generating the best returns for his investors. He was part of the national frenzy to turn foreclosures into single-family rentals. After the housing bust, when the economy and the real estate business improved, he shifted toward house flips and “value-add” apartment deals, a euphemism for buying a run-down complex, clearing out the tenants, then renovating and raising the rent. It’s an equation of risk versus profit: In a world in which the need for housing is high but it’s hard to build, upscaling properties is a safer way to make money than trying to develop new ones. Mr. Spicer discovered backyard units after a serendipitous encounter with a city inspector. The inspector came by to check the electrical work at a house he was renovating (and planned to flip), then busted him for tearing out the kitchen without a permit. Mr. Spicer had to pay a year of extra mortgage payments while the work was stalled for city approval. During the wait, a drafter he had hired suggested that he convert the detached garage into a separate unit, which would increase the purchase price. It was so easy to build and the permitting so fast, Mr. Spicer said, he followed the returns to a new line of business. Now, for the first time in his career, he is trying to make money by building new housing instead of by making existing housing more expensive. During a visit to some of his projects, Mr. Spicer drove around town in a dusty black Tesla that had uncashed checks scattered around the center console. Dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, he played a version of an HGTV host, taking me through recently purchased houses and using a mix of imagination and finger points to explain how, with a wall here and door there and two units back there, the rental value could be multiplied several times over. Instead of hunting for easy house flips, Mr. Spicer said, he’s on the lookout for homes on abnormally large lots with a flat, neglected yard that is primed to start building on. Anything with a pool is out of the question, he said. A home with an elaborate garden can work but costs extra to rip out. “If it’s all dirt back there, that’s the golden ticket,” he said. Mr. Spicer’s turn of fortune was a byproduct of California’s efforts to fill its housing shortage. Over the past five years the Legislature has passed a half-dozen laws that make it vastly easier to build accessory dwelling units (A.D.U.s) — a catchall term for homes that are more colloquially known as in-law units and granny flats. Cities have lost most of their power to prevent backyard units from being built, and state legislators have tried to speed construction by reducing development fees, requiring cities to permit them within a few weeks and prohibiting local governments from requiring dedicated parking spots. In contrast to the battles over S.B. 9 — this year’s duplex law, which was branded a bill of “chaos” that would “destroy neighborhoods” and be “the beginning of the end of homeownership in California” — the A.D.U. laws passed with no comparable controversy. “‘Granny units’ doesn’t sound intimidating,” said Bob Wieckowski, a state senator from the Bay Area city of Fremont, who has passed three A.D.U. bills since 2016. Last year, San Diego’s City Council voted unanimously to expand on state law by allowing bonus units, sometimes as many as a half-dozen per lot, if a portion are set aside for moderate-income households. Development has exploded on cue. California cities issued about 13,000 permits for accessory units in 2020, which is a little over 10 percent of the state’s new housing stock and up from less than 1 percent eight years ago. The effect is already visible throughout Southern California: four-unit buildings rising behind one-story bungalows; prefabricated studio apartments being hoisted into backyards via crane; blocks where a new front-yard apartment sits across the street from a new backyard apartment down the way from a new side-yard apartment. In response to the new legislation, entrepreneurs have started a host of companies that specialize in helping people plan, design and build backyard units and the coming wave of duplexes. Venture capitalists have put hundreds of millions of dollars into start-ups like Abodu, which is based in Redwood City, Calif., and builds backyard units in a factory, then delivers them on a truck. Until recently, their business was driven by homeowners building A.D.U.s on their property. But over the past year there has been a surge in interest from upstart developers like Mr. Spicer, according to interviews with planners, lenders and contractors. Scrawled across a whiteboard in Mr. Spicer’s office, just past three Red Bull-quaffing employees who sit in front of double-screen computers searching for property and managing renovations, was a list of 32 new units that were finished or being worked on. That’s the equivalent of a midsize apartment building. Except unlike a midsize apartment building, which could take years of permitting and environmental reviews before construction even started, Mr. Spicer’s projects require about the amount of bureaucracy of a kitchen and bath remodel. His company bought 5120 Baxter Street for $700,000. He estimates the house would rent for $3,300 a month with a few renovations. Instead he spent about $400,000 building the new units and splitting the house, and believes he will get between $9,000 and $10,000 a month in rent across the property. That return would increase the property’s value to about $1.7 million. The price would be galling to an aspiring homeowner who might have outbid another family before losing to Mr. Spicer and now feels cheated out of the American dream. But of course the 10 to 12 people who move in are unlikely to think the world would be better off if their homes had remained dirt and only one family lived there. Housing is complicated. No backyard apartment buildings. The yard signs have started to appear. This particular one was on Budd Street in Clairemont Mesa, about a 10-minute drive from the house on Baxter Street. When I arrived on the block to ask the neighbors about San Diego’s surge in backyard apartments, one discontented resident became two and two became a half-dozen. Suddenly I was in a semicircle absorbing dark prognostications from homeowners in shorts and gardening clothes, along with a grandmother holding a baby. “It doesn’t fit.” “It’s adding people.” “We don’t want that here.” “There’s other places for that.” “We just want to keep our neighborhood like it is.” “They want to push us out and tear our houses down.” “Parking.” “Parking.” “Parking.” The signs were supplied by Neighbors for a Better San Diego, a nonprofit that has called on the city to rescind its expanded A.D.U. rules. It’s tricky politics, requiring legislators to grapple with the housing crisis by planning for more units while also dealing with blowback from the constituents who vote for them in the present. Trying to thread this line, Sean Elo-Rivera, a 38-year-old San Diego councilman, recently introduced a series of proposals that would levy infrastructure fees on A.D.U. developers like Mr. Spicer, limit how much on-street parking their residents could use, and lower the income threshold that developers needed to meet to qualify for the city’s density bonus program. But during a walk around his neighborhood he reiterated his support for higher density and illustrated this fact by stopping in front of a six-unit apartment building on a street of single-family houses. “This is the nightmare scenario for a lot of the more vocal opponents,” he said. He noted the building was where he lived in a one-bedroom with his wife. Housing politics are nonpartisan: The term NIMBY, short for “not in my backyard,” applies to Democrats as well as Republicans. Interviews with more than a dozen A.D.U. opponents throughout the city returned an ideologically scattered mix of complaints with a crosscurrent of motivations. They don’t want low-income housing in their neighborhood and also want new units to be more affordable. Some want backyards to remain open. Others are building A.D.U.s but think adding more than one unit is too much. One complained about Airbnb rentals. Another complained that noise from a neighboring A.D.U. had made it harder to rent his Airbnb. They were fervently for, and against, the attempted recall of Governor Newsom. If there is one thing they all seem to agree on, a villain whose actions elicit so much rage that it unites this disparate group, it’s that Christian Spicer is the bad guy here. “My biggest fear is developers are pricing everybody out of the market,” said Pattie Estrada, a 59-year-old commercial loan processor. Ms. Estrada was part of the Budd Street scrum and has lived on the block for 30 years. As we walked away from her angry neighbors, she told me that her oldest daughter lived in a manufactured home with her husband and 3-year-old and wants to upgrade to a house. The daughter’s family can’t afford Clairemont when houses are going for $850,000. A few doors away stood a house with a For Sale sign. Ms. Estrada pointed to it and said she wanted to help her daughter buy it, but was worried an investor would outbid them. This would be a huge disappointment, because the house had a yard with the potential to help her solve two problems at once. “My daughter will be 30, and I have another daughter who is 21 — she still lives at home,” Ms. Estrada said. “I’m thinking we can do an A.D.U. back there for her. She can have her own little place, too.” So: Pattie Estrada is worried about developers turning single-family houses into multiple units, but on account of the rising cost of housing is doing the same herself. It seems like a contradiction, but within it lies a subtle but profound shift. Hatred of real estate developers (save for the one who built your home) is practically a condition of living in California. And every era has its growth skeptics. In the mid-1950s, when Clairemont had 7,000 homes and 5,000 more under construction or in planning, a local illustrator named Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, drew a series of anti-development cartoons with names like “Whither California?” and pictures of hills choked with homes. But Ms. Estrada isn’t precisely complaining about growth — she’s mad that investors like Mr. Spicer have become a source of competition that could crowd out families that might develop land for one another. “If you want to build your garage into a A.D.U. or you want to put one in your backyard — God bless you, that’s awesome,” she said. “But I know these developers, and it’s all about profit. It’s all about the money.” For three-quarters of a century, the California dream has been synonymous with a house like 5120 Baxter and its cousins in the postwar suburbs. But there was an earlier version of California living, one where urban neighborhoods had apartments next to houses and suburbs had boarding units and small-scale farms that families used for food and extra income, making their property work for them. The state’s housing future is starting to look like that homestead past. On Ms. Estrada’s block, a number of homeowners already have their adult children living in backyard apartments, along with aunts and uncles in converted garages. Units without permits are a common enough sight in Clairemont that Mr. Logue, the teacher on Baxter Street, called it “the Clairemont remodel.” None of this is atypical: California has long had some of the most overcrowded homes in the country, and researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, estimate that the Los Angeles metropolitan area has over 300,000 unpermitted units. Some were built for income. Others were built for family. Whatever the reason, they are now a crucial piece of the housing stock and home to a city’s worth of people. Legalized A.D.U.s are just a higher-end version of the same idea. This theme shows up in surveys of A.D.U. rents, which are affordable compared with similarly sized units in the area. It’s not because they are undesirable. It’s that a lot of them are discounted for friends and free to family. Ms. Estrada didn't get the house down the street. Another family bought it. No matter: She plans to employ the state’s new A.D.U. laws to develop her own property to the max, adding a 1,200-square-foot apartment above her house and making the garage a one-bedroom. Her parents will live there. Her adult daughters will live there. She has already hired an architect. “A house for me was security for me and my husband,” she said. “And now we’re going to use it to secure our daughters’ future.” The model homes advertised in the Clairemont Villas brochure are still standing, wrapped around a corner of Clairemont Drive. Fading white picket fences enclose the front yards. On a recent afternoon, one had its garage door raised. Inside were crates of canned goods and produce along with a half-dozen shopping carts loaded with bags of groceries. Nobody was living inside: The dream house is now a food bank.

The districts are in Alachua, Brevard, Broward, Duval, Leon, Miami-Dade, Orange and Palm Beach Counties. The measure was approved unanimously during a conference call meeting on Thursday by the State Board of Education, all of whose members are appointees by Republican governors. The vote came after superintendents from the eight districts argued their mask policies had been effective at curbing the spread of the virus. After the vote, one of the superintendents, Alberto M. Carvalho of Miami-Dade County Public Schools, noted on Twitter there had been “no major outbreaks” in his district and that student cases had been declining after a spike in early September. “We disagree with today’s State Board of Education’s recommendation and wholeheartedly believe that we are in compliance with law, reason, and science,” he said in a Twitter post. But the state board said that the county school boards had “willingly and knowingly violated the rights of students and parents by denying them the option to make personal and private health care and educational decisions for their children.” State mask rules can differ from C.D.C. guidance, and some governors are setting separate policies for schools. Masks in schools have become the center of a fiercely partisan debate in Florida, Texas, Arizona and other states whose Republican governors oppose mask mandates as an infringement on personal liberties. In late July, Governor DeSantis, a possible Republican presidential candidate, signed an executive order directing state officials to ensure parents have the power to decide whether children wear masks in school. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that all students, teachers and employees wear masks, regardless of their vaccination status. Most masks offer far more protection to others than to the person wearing them, dispersing the exhaled aerosols that carry the coronavirus in an infected person. So individual masking undermines the protection the masks offer. President Biden, a Democrat, has openly criticized the Republican governors blocking local mask mandates, and the federal Department of Education has started investigating whether such policies in five states violate the civil rights of disabled students. Lawsuits have also been filed in a number of states, including Florida, challenging bans on mask mandates. In late August, a federal judge said that Florida’s state constitution allowed school districts to impose strict mask mandates on students, handing Mr. DeSantis a defeat. The state asked an appellate court to reverse the ruling, which has been stayed temporarily pending a final decision. On Thursday, the Florida school board maintained that a “parents’ bill of rights” enacted by state lawmakers earlier this year gave parents the sole right to decide if their children should wear masks. The board’s statement said that the law requires districts and schools to “protect parents’ right to make health care decisions such as masking of their children in relation to Covid-19.” “Every school board member and every school superintendent has a duty to comply with the law, whether they agree with it or not,” the chairman of the state board, Tom Grady, said in the statement. — Johnny Diaz  The sheriff of Los Angeles County reiterated this week that he would not compel members of his staff to be inoculated against the coronavirus, in defiance of the county’s order that all of its 110,000 employees show proof of vaccination by Oct. 1.  “No, I am not forcing anyone,” said Sheriff Alex Villanueva, after reading aloud a submitted question in a town hall-style event streamed live on Facebook on Wednesday. “The issue has become so politicized there are entire groups of employees that are willing to be fired and laid off rather than get vaccinated,” the sheriff said, adding that he could not afford to lose any staff over the county mandate. LA Sheriff Villanueva says that he will not enforce a vaccine mandate, saying employees are willing to get fired over it. ""I don't want to be in a position to lose 5, 10% of my workforce overnight on a vaccine mandate."" pic.twitter.com/9DNJTeJUoY The L.A. County Sheriff’s Department has more than 10,000 officers and 8,000 civilian staff members. It has suffered at least 18 coronavirus outbreaks, accounting for 334 cases, according to an investigative report in the Los Angeles Times last month.  The defiance of Sheriff Villanueva — a politically divisive figure — underlines the difficulty of trying to lift lagging vaccination rates among law enforcement officers across the country. In many cities, officials are worried about losing officers. The New York Police Department, the nation’s largest, said that 67 percent of its staff have had at least one dose. That’s despite a city mandate that went into effect last month that requires city workers to get vaccinated or submit to weekly testing. “I would be supportive of a vaccine mandate,” Dermot F. Shea, New York’s police commissioner, said on Thursday during a news conference with Mayor Bill DeBlasio.  Other cities’ forces have far lower vaccination rates. Memphis and Louisville recently reported that fewer than half of its officers have been vaccinated. The Fraternal Order of Police, a national union that represents 356,000 officers, estimates that 724 officers have died from Covid-19 since the pandemic began. In Los Angeles, Hilda Solis, the chair of the county’s board of supervisors, signed an executive order in August directing all county employees to show proof of a coronavirus vaccination by Oct. 1. The order did not provide for a testing option as some other local governments have done.  Sheriff Villanueva’s refusal to enforce that requirement is familiar. In July, when Los Angeles County became the first major county to revert to requiring masks for all people indoors in public spaces, he said that his officers would not be enforcing the mandate. “Forcing the vaccinated and those who already contracted Covid-19 to wear masks indoors is not backed by science,” Sheriff Villanueva wrote in a statement on his website, adding that his department “will not expend our limited resources and instead ask for voluntary compliance.” — Adeel Hassan  With the Nets star Kyrie Irving potentially set to lose more than $380,000 for missing a preseason game Friday night, the N.B.A. players’ association pushed back on the league’s plan to dock the pay of unvaccinated players for any games they miss this season because of local coronavirus ordinances. Irving, a union vice president, has not spoken publicly about his vaccination status, instead asking for privacy. New York requires most teens and adults to have at least one vaccination shot to enter facilities such as sports arenas, and Irving has not practiced with the Nets in Brooklyn. The team listed him as “ineligible to play” in its injury report before Friday’s preseason home opener against the Milwaukee Bucks at Barclays Center. For Irving, the $380,000 represents about 1 percent of his base pay for the 2021-22 season. A disagreement between the league and the players’ union over lost pay hinges on a section of the collective bargaining agreement that allows the league to discipline players who, “without proper and reasonable cause or excuse,” fail to fulfill their contractual obligations. Mike Bass, a league spokesman, said last week that “any player who elects not to comply with local vaccination mandates will not be paid for games that he misses.” The union has rejected instituting a leaguewide vaccine mandate. Irving’s indefinite absence from home games — and from practices — has created a predicament for the Nets, a team with championship aspirations that must weigh whether having him around only half the time is worth it. His teammates have said they support him. Steve Nash, the Nets’ coach, said the team would not move its practices to a location outside of New York to accommodate Irving. The Nets, who have not said publicly whether Irving is vaccinated, held their training camp in San Diego. “No, this is our home,” Nash said. “This is where we’re going to practice, and we have almost a whole group. So that’s a positive, and we’re just working at getting better every day and focusing on the things we can control.” Barclays Center and Madison Square Garden, where the Knicks play, require all employees and guests 12 and older to show proof of having received at least one vaccine dose, to comply with a city mandate, unless they have a religious or medical exemption. San Francisco has a similar requirement that applies to Chase Center, where the Golden State Warriors play. The mandates in both cities mean that the players from the Knicks, Nets and Golden State cannot play in their teams’ 41 home games without being vaccinated. — Scott Cacciola  The Russian authorities have repeatedly delayed inspections by the European Union’s main drug regulator that are required for the approval of its Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine, the bloc’s ambassador to Russia told the country’s news media on Friday. Moscow has criticized the bloc for not approving the vaccine’s use sooner, but the ambassador, Markus Ederer, said that the extended timeline was not politically motivated. “The Russian side has repeatedly postponed the timing of the inspection requested by the E.M.A., which slows down the process,” Mr. Ederer told the local outlet RBC, referring to the European Medicines Agency. “These are the facts.” Sputnik V has been approved for use in more than 70 countries, according to the Russian Direct Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth fund that backed the vaccine’s development. But it has not been approved by the European regulator or the World Health Organization. That creates difficulties for Russians traveling to the European Union and to the United States. Mr. Ederer pushed back against regular assertions by the Russian authorities that the lack of approval was political. “This is a technical rather than a political process,” he said. “When Russian officials talk about the process being delayed and politicized by the European side, I sometimes think they are largely referring to themselves, because it is they who make this about politics.” Russia’s health ministry said in a statement carried by the state news agency TASS on Friday that the European regulator had received the required documents by the end of September. E.M.A. officials could visit in December, it said. Separately, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organization said on Friday that the agency was “near” to resolving outstanding issues with certifying Sputnik V. “We are slowly solving most of the issues,” the spokeswoman, Fadéla Chaib, said at a news briefing in Geneva, without elaborating on a timeline. Russia’s health minister, Mikhail Murashko, said last week that all that remained for the W.H.O. certification was some paperwork. Once the United Nations agency receives all of the necessary data and inspects the production sites, it can schedule a meeting to validate a vaccine for an emergency-use listing. In Russia, vaccine skepticism and nonchalance about the virus have led to climbing infection rates. On Friday, the country recorded a record 936 Covid deaths and 27,246 new infections. — Valerie Hopkins  A surge driven by the Delta variant is receding in the United States, but officials and experts say that increased transmission during the coming colder months remains a threat and that steady rates of vaccination are key to keeping the coronavirus at bay. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday that about 56 percent of the U.S. population was fully vaccinated. Providers are administering an average of about 949,000 doses per day, including first, second and additional doses, far below the April peak but higher than the recent Sept. 28 low point of about 625,000, according to a New York Times database. Surveys from the Kaiser Family Foundation show that vaccine support has been rising out of fear of the Delta variant: Almost 40 percent of newly inoculated respondents said they had sought the vaccines because of the rise in cases, and more than a third said they had become alarmed by overcrowding in local hospitals and rising death rates. The number of people eligible for vaccinations could also soon increase substantially: Pfizer and BioNTech asked federal regulators on Thursday to authorize emergency use of their coronavirus vaccine for children ages 5 to 11, a move that could help protect more than 28 million people in the United States. The companies say they are submitting data supporting the change to the Food and Drug Administration. The agency has promised to move quickly on the request and has tentatively scheduled a meeting on Oct. 26 to consider it. An F.D.A. ruling is expected as early as the end of this month. Rupali Limaye, a behavior scientist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who studies vaccine hesitancy, said that parents’ getting their children aged 5 to 11 vaccinated would be a “huge game changer” because they represent a large proportion of population. Vaccine mandates have also been taking effect recently, with federal workers and contractors, teachers, health care providers and others compelled to get immunized or risk losing their jobs. Such a requirement for New York teachers spurred thousands of last-minute vaccinations. Tyson Foods reported a 91 percent vaccination rate ahead of a November deadline, compared with less than half before its mandate was announced in August. President Biden appealed on Thursday for more companies to mandate Covid vaccinations for employees, asking them to take initiative because an effort that he announced last month to require 80 million American workers to get the shot undergoes a rule-making process and may not go into effect for weeks. A report released by the White House on Thursday sought to show how vaccine mandates had helped persuade more people to receive their shots: Seventy-eight percent of eligible adults have had at least a first dose. As the country nears colder temperatures that will push many indoors, Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Stanford, said that the next few months would be critical, but that the combination of increased vaccinations and natural immunity from infections could prevent another catastrophic wave like the one that struck last year. “Most of us don’t think we’re going to see the terrible surge we saw last winter,” she said. “That was horrific. I hope we never have to live through something like that again.” — Lauren McCarthy  While wealthier countries with higher coronavirus vaccination rates are increasingly reopening their borders and their economies, nations with more restricted vaccine access are having to make tougher moves. In Mozambique, that has meant closing popular beaches this week over fears of spreading the virus, less than two weeks after they were cautiously reopened. The authorities fear that beaches along the Indian Ocean — which are at the center of the country’s tourism industry and its communal life — could become infection hot spots or encourage a lax attitude toward Covid-19 regulations. Just 5 percent of Mozambique’s adult population is fully vaccinated against the virus, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And the authorities have warned that life cannot yet return to normal, even as temperatures rise and summer approaches. The Mozambican government announced the closure on Wednesday, immediately shuttering 18 beaches around the capital, Maputo, and in resort towns like Xai Xai and Tofo, for at least two weeks. It’s a stark contrast with neighboring South Africa, which has the continent’s highest number of Covid-19 infections but has eased restrictions and kept its beaches open as vaccination rates climb steadily. Other popular Indian Ocean tourist destinations, like the islands of Mauritius and the Seychelles, have welcomed the return of tourists after successful vaccination campaigns. Mozambique has recorded an average of just 30 daily coronavirus cases in the last seven days and no new Covid deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Still, the country, which has recorded 150,899 cases since the start of the pandemic, has enforced strict measures to keep infections low. The authorities reopened the beaches on Sept. 23 as the country emerged from a third wave of infections, although the reopening came with a warning that the easing of restrictions did not mean the end of the pandemic. Officials continued to impose strict regulations on beaches in particular, banning the consumption of alcohol, gatherings and games, and imposing a 5 p.m. closing time. Beachgoers were warned that flouting the rules would lead to swift action. And that came this week as a government spokesman, Filimão Suazi, announced the closing of some of Mozambique’s most popular beaches, blaming “bad behavior.” Mozambique entered its third wave of infections earlier this year, with over 4,400 new cases reported in the first week of July. With only three doctors per 100,000 people, according to the U.S. Embassy in Mozambique, the country’s health facilities were strained. The authorities moved quickly to close schools, limit shopping times at markets and impose an overnight curfew. — Lynsey Chutel  England has reduced to just seven the number of “red list” countries that it considers the highest coronavirus risk and from which it requires travelers to quarantine in government-designated hotels upon arrival. The change, announced on Thursday, removes 47 countries and territories from the list, including Afghanistan, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa. Taking effect on Monday at 4 a.m. local time, it lifts a set of restrictions that have separated family members and thwarted business travel and vacations. Residents and officials in restricted countries have in recent months called for the measures to be lifted as their infection numbers have fallen and vaccinations have risen. One online petition asking that Turkey be removed from the list gained nearly 49,000 signatures. “We’re making it easier for families and loved ones to reunite, by significantly cutting the number of destinations on the red list, thanks in part to the increased vaccination efforts around the globe,” Grant Shapps, Britain’s transportation secretary, said in a statement. The countries remaining on the list are all in Latin America or the Caribbean: Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Haiti, Panama, Peru and Venezuela. Fully vaccinated people arriving from countries not on the red list will no longer be required to take a coronavirus test before traveling to England, although they must still pay for a test on the second day after their arrival. Unvaccinated people traveling from these destinations will still have to take a pre-departure test, plus tests on their second and eighth days after arriving, and will still be required to isolate for 10 days. The changes followed an announcement this week that England’s three-tiered traffic light-inspired system was being reduced to a single “red list.” Testing and quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated arrivals were also eased. Sajid Javid, Britain’s health secretary, cited what he called the country’s “phenomenal progress” in vaccination. Seventy-three percent of people in Britain have received a single dose, and 67 percent are fully vaccinated, according to figures collated by Our World in Data. — Aina J.

Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics By Ella Koeze Job growth slowed to the year’s weakest pace last month as the latest coronavirus wave dashed hopes of an imminent return to normal for the U.S. economy. Employers added just 194,000 jobs in September, the Labor Department said Friday, down from 366,000 in August — and far below the increase of more than one million in July, before the highly contagious Delta variant led to a spike in coronavirus cases across much of the country. Leisure and hospitality businesses, a main driver of job growth earlier this year, added fewer than 100,000 jobs for the second straight month. “Employment is slowing when it should be picking up because we’re still on the course set by the virus,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist for the accounting firm Grant Thornton. The economic news is not all gloomy. The unemployment rate fell sharply to 4.8 percent, and wages again rose strongly as companies outside the most Covid-affected industries snapped up available workers, and paid a premium to do so. The government revised its estimate of August job growth upward, and economists said the September figures would have looked stronger had it not been for statistical quirks in measuring public-school hiring.

             Data is seasonally adjusted. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics By Ella Koeze But even the good news came with caveats. The unemployment rate declined in part because fewer people were in the labor force, a sign that the hiring challenges that have bedeviled employers all year won’t be quickly resolved. Rising wages could add to concerns about inflation. And the conflicting signals could complicate decisions for the Biden administration and for the Federal Reserve, which is weighing when to begin pulling back support for the economy. It is possible that the recent slowdown is a Delta-driven blip and will soon fade — or, indeed, may already be largely in the past. The data released on Friday was collected in mid-September, when the Delta wave was near its peak. Since then, cases and hospitalizations have fallen in much of the country, and more timely data from private-sector sources suggests that economic activity has begun to rebound. If those trends continue, people on the sidelines could return to the labor force, and hiring should begin to pick up. “This report is a glance in the rearview mirror,” said Daniel Zhao, an economist at the career site Glassdoor. “There should be some optimism that there should be a reacceleration in October.” But it is also possible that the damage done by the pandemic will take longer to heal than economists had hoped. Supply-chain disruptions have been unexpectedly persistent, and shifts in consumer behavior during the pandemic may not soon reverse. In surveys, many workers say they are reconsidering their priorities and do not want to return to their old ways of working. Policymakers at the Fed are hoping that the Delta disruptions will prove short-lived. Fed officials have signaled that they will soon begin to pull back their support for the economy by slowing their purchase of bonds, something they could announce as soon as November. The September jobs report will probably not derail those plans, which officials have said were based on cumulative job gains and not a single month’s data. The United States has regained more than 17 million jobs since the worst depths of the pandemic. The Biden administration, too, is focused on the longer term. In remarks at the White House on Friday, President Biden highlighted the drop in the unemployment rate and other signs of progress, while conceding he would like to see more rapid job creation in the months ahead. “When you take a step back and look at what’s happening, we are making real progress,” Mr. Biden said. “Maybe it does not seem fast enough. I would like to see it faster, and we’re going to make it faster.” Cumulative change in jobs since before the pandemic, by industry  –1 mil. –2 –3 –4 –5 –6 –7 –8 April Jan. ’21 +74,000 in September 16.9 million jobs in Feb. 2020 –2 –1 mil.

Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics By Ella Koeze One reason for optimism is that the Delta variant’s economic impact, while significant, has been somewhat contained. Construction companies and manufacturers reported strong job growth in September, despite supply-chain difficulties, and retail hiring rebounded after two months of declines. The biggest drag on employment in September was in the public sector. Government payrolls shrank by 123,000 jobs, with most of the losses in education. But economists said that decline probably reflected the way the Labor Department accounts for seasonal patterns, which the pandemic disrupted. On an unadjusted basis, federal, state and local government employment actually grew by close to 900,000 workers in September. Because that’s fewer than in a typical September, the seasonal adjustment formula interprets it as a loss in jobs. But by any measure, job growth has slowed significantly since earlier in the year. And the data released on Friday provided a stark reminder of the power the pandemic still holds over the economy, and of the long road ahead even once it is over. There are five million fewer people on U.S. payrolls than in February 2020, and 2.7 million people have been out of work for six months or more, the standard threshold for long-term unemployment. Yet job openings are at a record high, and many employers report having a hard time filling positions.

             Data is seasonally adjusted. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics By Ella Koeze September was meant to be the month the hiring logjam began to abate. Expanded unemployment benefits, which many businesses blamed for discouraging people from looking for work, ended nationwide early last month. Schools reopened in person in much of the country, which should have made it easier for parents to return to work. Rising vaccination rates were meant to make reluctant workers feel safe enough to resume their job searches. As recently as August, many economists circled September as the month when workers would flood back into the job market. Instead, the labor force shrank by nearly 200,000 people. The pandemic’s resurgence delayed office reopenings, disrupted the start of the school year and made some people reluctant to accept jobs requiring face-to-face interaction. At the same time, preliminary evidence suggests that the cutoff in unemployment benefits has done little to push people back to work.

             Data is seasonally adjusted. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics By Ella Koeze “I am a little bit puzzled, to be honest,” said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist for the investment bank Jefferies. “We all waited for September for this big flurry of hiring on the premise that unemployment benefits and school reopening would bring people back to the labor force. And it just doesn’t seem like we’re seeing that.” Ms. Markowska said more people might begin to look for work as the Delta variant eased and as they depleted savings accumulated earlier in the pandemic. But some people have retired early or have found other ways to make ends meet and may be slow to return to the labor force, if they come back at all. In the meantime, people available to work are enjoying a rare moment of leverage. Average earnings rose 19 cents an hour in September and are up more than $1 an hour over the last year, after a series of strong monthly gains. Pay has risen even faster in some low-wage sectors.

Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics By Ella Koeze Many businesses are finding that higher wages alone aren’t enough to attract workers, said Becky Frankiewicz, president of the Manpower Group, a staffing firm. After years of expecting employees to work whenever they were needed — often with no set schedule and little notice — companies are finding that workers are now setting the terms. “They get to choose when, where and in what duration they’re working,” Ms. Frankiewicz said. “That is a role reversal. That is a structural change in the workers’ economy.” Arizmendi Bakery, a cooperative in San Rafael, Calif., recently raised its wages by $3 an hour, by far the biggest increase in its history. But it is still struggling to attract applicants heading into the crucial holiday season. “There are many, many, many more businesses hiring than there used to be, so we’re competing with many other businesses that we weren’t competing with before,” said Natalie Baddorf, a baker and one of the owners. The bakery has managed to hire a few people, including one who began this week. But other workers have given their notice to leave. The bakery, which has been operating on reduced hours since the pandemic began, now has enough business to return to its original hours, but cannot find enough labor to do so. “We’re talking about cloning ourselves,” Ms. Baddorf said.

Under the plan, known as Vaccinated Travel Lanes, fully vaccinated people traveling between Singapore and those countries will subject only to Covid-19 PCR tests instead of quarantining, according to the transportation ministry. Those travelers will also have no restrictions on their purpose of travel and will not be required to have a controlled itinerary or sponsorship, the ministry said. The change regarding South Korea takes effect on Nov. 15, according to the ministry. The plan with the United States will begin before the end of the year, The Straits Times reported, citing a speech by Gan Kim Yong, Singapore’s trade minister, in Washington on Thursday. Email messages to the ministry seeking comment were not immediately returned on Friday. The Vaccinated Travel Lanes are one of the biggest reopening steps being taken by Singapore, a major economic and transportation hub, after early successes in thwarting the coronavirus and then a sharp setback in controlling its spread. Singapore was widely considered a success story in its initial handling of the pandemic, closing its borders, testing and tracing aggressively, and ordering vaccines early. Singapore has now fully inoculated 83 percent of its population, and a top politician told the public in August that an 80 percent vaccination rate was the criterion for a phased reopening.

The United States said its citizens should reconsider travel to the country, emergency departments in several Singapore hospitals were crowded,NA, there were nagging questions about what it would take to reopen if vaccines were not enough. For many, the repeated tweaks to the restrictions have taken a toll. The number of suicides in 2020 was the highest since 2012, a trend that some mental health experts have attributed to the pandemic. — Sui-Lee Wee and Azi Paybarah  Tesla will move its headquarters from California to Austin, Texas, the company’s chief executive, Elon Musk, said on Thursday, a move that makes good on a threat that he issued more than a year ago when he was frustrated by coronavirus lockdown orders that forced Tesla to pause production at its factory in Fremont, Calif. Mr. Musk was an outspoken early critic of pandemic restrictions, calling them “fascist” and predicting in March 2020 that there would be almost no new cases of virus infections by the end of April. In December, he said he had moved himself to Texas to be near the company’s new factory. His other company, SpaceX, launches rockets from the state. “There’s a limit to how big you can scale in the Bay Area,” Mr. Musk said at Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting on Thursday, adding that high housing prices there translated to long commutes for some employees. The company’s Texas factory, which is near Austin and will manufacture Tesla’s Cybertruck, is minutes from downtown and from an airport, he said. Tesla is one of several California companies to say they were moving to Texas in recent months. Hewlett Packard Enterprise said in December that it was moving to the Houston area, and Charles Schwab has moved to a suburb of Dallas and Fort Worth. Tesla is on track to sell about a million cars this year and is planning a major expansion. In addition to the Austin factory, Tesla is building one near Berlin. Its headquarters have been in Palo Alto for more than a decade. — Niraj Chokshi  The unexpected drop in hiring in September may have been a result of quirks in the way the government reports the data. But the broader recent slowdown is no statistical fluke — the rise of the Delta variant has clearly taken a toll on the economy. The Labor Department said on Friday that government employment fell by 123,000 jobs in September, with most of the losses coming in education. But public schools didn’t actually lay off tens of thousands of teachers, custodians and other workers. That figure is seasonally adjusted, meaning that it tries to account for predictable annual patterns in hiring and firing. One of the most predictable patterns of all: Schools hire lots of workers in September, and lay them off in June and July. The pandemic, however, has disrupted those patterns. Early in the pandemic, many schools laid off workers earlier than usual. This year, some schools started hiring earlier than usual, meaning they also did less hiring in September than in most years. (Another possible factor: Many school districts have reported having difficulty hiring bus drivers and other workers, which could be holding down job growth.)

Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics By Ella Koeze On an unadjusted basis, the government actually added close to 900,000 workers in September. Because that’s fewer than in a typical September, the seasonal adjustment formula interprets it as a loss in jobs. Seasonal adjustment can help explain why job growth was weaker in September than in August, but it can’t explain why job growth in the last two months has been weaker than in the spring and early summer. That slowdown is real, and it reflects the impact of the Delta variant. Employers in leisure and hospitality, one of the sectors hit hardest by the pandemic, added hundreds of thousands of jobs per month from February through July, as restaurants reopened and Americans began traveling more. But the sector added just 38,000 jobs in August and 74,000 in September. Overall, private sector job growth has slowed to a pace of a bit above 300,000 a month over the last two months, from more than 800,000 a month in June and July. Job growth in sectors less affected by the pandemic was relatively strong in September, however. Construction companies, manufacturers and retailers all added jobs, suggesting that the effects of the latest virus wave have been fairly contained. — Ben Casselman  San Francisco plans to ease face-mask requirements in limited settings, health officials said on Thursday. The change, set to take effect on Oct. 15, is dependent on coronavirus cases and hospitalization rates remaining stable or declining. In settings such as offices, gyms, fitness centers, religious gatherings and college classes, people will be permitted to remove their mask if everyone present is vaccinated and their status has been verified. The new rule applies only to gatherings that do not exceed 100 people. The employer or host is also required to ensure proper ventilation, verify that there have been no recent Covid-19 outbreaks and make sure that no children under 12 are present, among other safety measures. California is among the states with the lowest number of newly reported coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents, according to a New York Times database. In San Francisco County, 74 percent of residents age 12 and older are fully vaccinated. “I’m excited that we’re once again at a place where we can begin easing the mask requirements, which is the direct result of the fact that we have one of the highest vaccination rates in the country, our cases have fallen, and our residents have done their part to keep themselves and those around them safe,” said Mayor London Breed. Ms. Breed called the eased restrictions “yet another milestone in our recovery” and said that “the City feels like it is coming alive again” on Twitter. Indoor mask mandates remain in place for most other public settings, including retail stores and other common areas like building elevators, lobbies and restrooms, and masks continue to be required at bars and restaurants except when patrons are eating or drinking. Proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test has been required to go indoors at bars, restaurants, clubs, gyms and large indoor events in San Francisco since late August. “Vaccines continue to be our path out of the pandemic, but masks have blunted the Delta-driven surge and protected our vital hospital capacity, while allowing businesses to remain open and children to return to school,” said Dr. Susan Philip, the city and county’s health officer. — Lauren McCarthy  For many college students, the pandemic’s arrival did more than disrupt their studies, threaten their health and shut down campus life. It also closed off the usual paths that lead from the classroom to jobs after graduation. Campus recruiting visits were abandoned, and the coronavirus-induced recession made companies pull back from hiring. But this year seniors and recent graduates are in great demand as white-collar employers staff up, with some job-seekers receiving multiple offers. The demand for college students at this stage of the pandemic — when overall U.S. employment remains more than five million jobs below the level in early 2020 — underscores the longstanding economic premium for people with a college education over holders of just a high school diploma. The unemployment rate for all workers with a college degree stood at 2.8 percent in August, compared with 6 percent for high school graduates with no college. What’s more, the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus has been a one-two punch for those lacking a college degree, hitting the sectors they depend on the most, like restaurants and bars," hotels and retail businesses. — Nelson D.

12,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/travel/travel-vaccine.html,"As International Travel Returns, Confusion Over Coronavirus Vaccines Reigns - The New York Times","Oct. 8, 2021Updated 12:50 p.m. ET","Advertisement Supported by Fragmented rules about which vaccines will be accepted and what documentation is needed, as well as a lack of compatibility between vaccine apps, have left many travelers frustrated. By Ceylan Yeginsu When Turkey was taken off Britain’s red list for travel last month, Sally Morrow, an English expatriate living in the Turkish capital of Ankara, rushed to her computer and booked flights to London, so that she could reunite with her ailing parents after more than six months apart. But soon after her ticket confirmation came through, Ms. Morrow, 47, read that the certificate she received when she was vaccinated in Turkey — with the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine — would not be accepted in Britain. As a result, Ms. Morrow would be required to quarantine for 10 days and take at least three negative coronavirus tests before being permitted to leave isolation there. “I had the Pfizer jab, the Rolls-Royce of vaccines, the exact same one as millions of Brits, yet I’m considered unvaccinated simply because I got my vaccine abroad,” Ms. Morrow said. “It’s outright discrimination and it’s a disgrace. What do they think? That Turks are selling knockoff vaccines at the Grand Bazaar?” she said, referring to the Ottoman-era market in Istanbul known for selling counterfeit designer merchandise. Over the summer, many countries across the world opened to international visitors following the successful rollout of vaccination programs, but fragmented rules about which vaccines will be accepted and what documentation is required, as well as a lack of compatibility between vaccine apps, have left many travelers confused and frustrated over where they can visit without extraordinary headaches and restrictions. More than 2.7 billion people around the world have been fully vaccinated with a range of vaccines that vary in degrees of efficacy, according to Our World in Data, an Oxford University Covid-19 database. Across Asia, the United Arab Emirates and South America, millions have received Sinopharm, Sinovac and other vaccines manufactured in China, but concern over their efficacy has resulted in many countries not recognizing them for the purpose of travel. Millions more who received domestic vaccines like the Sputnik V in Russia and Covaxin in India, which have not received approval from the World Health Organization, are also limited in where they can go. Britain eased its travel rules this week, expanding the list of vaccination certificates it recognizes from other countries and territories, including Turkey and India, but certificates from many nations in Africa and South America were excluded. In terms of vaccines, the United Kingdom, the 27-member European Union and the 26-country Schengen Area accept the four vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency — AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson — but Britain and many E.U. states do not recognize the Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines, despite their approval by the World Health Organization. The United States is still in a “regulatory process” to determine which vaccines it will accept when the country opens to fully vaccinated travelers in November, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement. But vaccines listed for emergency use by the W.H.O., including AstraZeneca, will be recognized, the agency said. The Sputnik V vaccine, which has been approved in more than 70 countries but not yet by the W.H.O., is unlikely to be accepted by the United States as it initially reopens for international travel. These confusing rules over approved vaccines are not limited to Britain and the United States. Experts warn that the haphazard and preferential approach to travel regulations is creating a two-tier system where people vaccinated with the most effective vaccines — mainly in the west — are able to cross borders freely, while those in developing countries who have received vaccines with a lower efficacy, are not. They fear that such policies will contribute to immunization hesitancy in parts of the world where the most widely accepted vaccines are not available. Melinda Mills, director of the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford and a lead author of a Royal Society report reviewing the feasibility of vaccine certificates, called the rules being developed “opaque and contradictory” and said they were “leaving people very frustrated.” “We are seeing cracks in these regulations where a country is on the red list of one country and on the green list of another, or when one type of vaccine is accepted by some countries, but not by others,” she added. “And many of these systems are not designed to handle people of multiple nationalities and those who work across borders.” To circumvent restrictions, some multinational travelers have received additional doses of different vaccines in another country — vaccines that are more widely accepted around the world. Anita Engel, 45, a German national who works in Dubai, received her second dose of the Sinopharm vaccine in the United Arab Emirates in June. She then got two shots of the Moderna vaccine when she went home to Germany in August. “The world opened up this summer, but I couldn’t go anywhere with the Sinopharm without having to quarantine or take PCR tests. Most places treat you like you are unvaccinated,” Ms. Engel said. “I got the Moderna in Germany, so that I could travel around Europe and reconnect with my friends, but I also feel safer because it provides more protection against the variants.” Ms. Engel experienced severe side effects after her second dose of the Moderna vaccine. A doctor told her she was having an adverse reaction to the high level of antibodies in her body, caused by mixing different vaccines in a short amount of time and that she should have gotten an antibody test before getting a third dose. “He told me I should have taken an antibody test before I had my third vaccine, and that I shouldn’t have made the decision without consulting a medical professional,” she recalled. “I felt stupid for taking a risk, but I won’t lie — it feels damn good to be able to travel again,” she said. The data on the efficacy and safety of mixing and matching vaccines is currently limited. An expert panel with the organization has issued a recommendation to use the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine as a second dose following a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, if a second dose of the same vaccine is not available. A clinical trial led by the University of Oxford has shown that mixing the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine generates a robust immune response against the coronavirus. In the initial stages of vaccination rollouts in the spring, some countries offered mixed doses of vaccines because of supply shortages. In Canada, at least 3.9 million people received two different shots and are now facing travel restrictions because many countries, including the U.S., only consider people with two identical doses fully vaccinated. “For Canadians, I think a booster shot to match one of the first vaccines doses will be the likely get-out-of-jail card,” said Ms. Mills, who is Dutch Canadian. Even after being permitted to enter a country, foreign visitors can face difficulties accessing establishments or services that require vaccine “passports” or certificates, like restaurants and museums, because of compatibility issues between types of verification software. On vacation in August, Jason Trenton, a 49-year-old music technician who got vaccinated in New York in April, was turned away from a restaurant in Paris because the hostess was unable to scan his Excelsior Pass, a mobile app issued by New York State. In June, France launched its own app, called the Health Pass, which stores vaccine certificates and PCR test results and is required to access bars, restaurants, shopping centers, tourist sites and public transport. At the time of Mr. Trenton’s visit, the system was not available to U.S. citizens. “Most places accept the C.D.C. paper vaccine card, but I didn’t want to carry it around with me because it’s so easy to lose,” Mr. Trenton said. “It’s all down to chance and you just have to hope that someone will accept your pass without scanning it. It worked in most places, but it’s stressful because you make reservations and plan your day but you don’t know if it will work out.” In some countries like Switzerland, travelers who are not from the surrounding E.U. must apply for domestic vaccine certificates that are needed for indoor dining and cultural activities, but getting one can take up to seven days. “It’s all very unnecessary and confusing,” said John Morris, 59, an English teacher who lives in Istanbul. He has decided not to go home until Britain recognizes the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine he received in Turkey. “These rules are just prejudiced against developing countries. I got this very good vaccine under a very efficient health system in Turkey, and I will travel to wherever accepts it.” Ms. Morrow, however, grew fed up of waiting to see her parents and boarded her flight to London this week. She is currently quarantining at a friend’s house for five days before she can take a PCR test that will allow her to leave isolation early. “I’m sharing a house with my friend Wendy, who has exactly the same vaccine as me, but yet for some reason that makes absolutely no sense, if she goes abroad and comes back she’s free to go straight to the pub, while I have lock myself up for days,” Ms. Morrow said. “These governments need to make rules that actually make sense and are backed up by data if they want people to respect and follow them.” Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

13,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/us/gary-maynard-alexandra-souverneva.html,"An Expert on the Criminal Mind, Now He’s Suspected in California Arson Spree - The New York Times","Oct. 8, 2021Updated 5:58 p.m. ET","Advertisement Supported by Amid a series of arson incidents across Northern California this year, a criminology professor was charged with setting a patch of the Sierra Nevada forest ablaze. By Thomas Fuller and Livia Albeck-Ripka LASSEN NATIONAL FOREST, Calif. — He drove out of the Lumberjacks restaurant parking lot on a Tuesday in August, up Main Street, past the fire station and the gun shop. Then, Gary Maynard left the small city of Susanville in the northeastern corner of California and headed up a steep highway into the Sierra Nevada, where, prosecutors say, he set the forest ablaze. Mr. Maynard, a criminology professor who specializes in deviancy, now sits in a Sacramento jail awaiting a hearing. The crime expert, investigators say, became a criminal himself. Arson, a crime whose perpetrators have included lawyers, dentists, millionaires and residents of homeless encampments, has for decades been a concern in California, where about 10 percent of wildfires every year are set on purpose, according to Cal Fire, the state’s largest fire agency. With megafires in recent years plaguing California, where forests and scrublands remain extremely desiccated by drought and other effects of climate change, the arsonist’s match is an especially potent threat. And the crime is on the rise: Last year the number of wildland arson fires in California rose by 6 percent, from 301 to 320. Over the past two months, three people suspected of arson in Northern California have been considered responsible for fires that burned thousands of acres and destroyed more than 200 homes and businesses. The fires that Mr. Maynard is accused of setting were put out before they could destroy any buildings. Explore maps of wildfires, air quality and smoke forecasts in California, Oregon, Washington and surrounding states. “The wildland arsonist is the most dangerous criminal in the world,” said Ed Nordskog, who has spent a career interrogating arsonists in California as an investigator in Los Angeles. “They can burn a whole town down in an hour.” In late September, the Fawn fire, which investigators say was set by Alexandra Souverneva, a yoga instructor from Silicon Valley and chemistry and biology graduate of the California Institute of Technology, injured three people and burned 185 structures north of Redding. An official with Cal Fire said that there was “overwhelming evidence” Ms. Souverneva intentionally lit the fire and that she might have been responsible for a vegetation fire the day before in the same area, according to court documents. Upon her arrest, the documents said, Ms. Souverneva said she had attempted to boil water she feared might be tainted with bear urine. Earlier that month, the Hopkins fire, which prosecutors say was set by a 20-year-old local resident, burned about 250 acres and destroyed 46 structures in Mendocino County, three hours north of San Francisco. The man, Devin Lamar Johnson, was on probation and now faces three charges of arson. Although some wildfires in California are ignited by lightning, a vast majority have nonnatural causes — sparks from electrical equipment, the heat of a lawn mower engine or, in the case of one of the state’s largest fires, a man hammering a stake into the ground. Arson is a particularly challenging problem because it is so hard to prevent. Convicted arsonists in California must register with a statewide database that currently lists 5,318 names, according to Gianni Muschetto, chief of the law enforcement program at Cal Fire. Some arson experts believe that the coronavirus pandemic has given rise to an increase in arson activity, along with higher rates of homicide, aggravated assault and car thefts. In California, the number of arson arrests jumped during the pandemic: 120 arson arrests were reported by Cal Fire in 2020 compared with 70 the year before. Arson offenses had been declining nationwide for the past few decades, but F.B.I. numbers show about 13 arson offenses per 100,000 people in 2020, about a 20 percent increase from the previous year. Arrests could also be up, experts say, because of increased vigilance by residents at a time of widespread fear of wildfires and the damage they have caused. Mr. Nordskog, who has interviewed more than 300 arsonists in his career, says it is a crime that crosses race and gender lines. The Hollywood portrayal of serial arsonists excited by fire and doing it for a thrill applies to a small subset of arsonists, he said. But more common are people frustrated with their jobs or family life or suffering mental health crises. “Most arsonists are just angry people,” he said. The case of Mr. Maynard, the criminology professor, appears to spotlight the stresses of the pandemic, links to mental illness and the arduous work of stopping arsonists before they cause irreparable harm. Investigators tracked Mr. Maynard’s movements using his food stamp transactions, phone records and a device they attached to his car in the Lumberjacks parking lot. An itinerant professor who received his doctorate in sociology from Stony Brook University in New York and taught at Santa Clara, Chapman and Sonoma State Universities, among others, Mr. Maynard had a particular fascination with the 1978 Jonestown massacre in Guyana. He wrote at least six articles related to Jonestown and Jim Jones, the cult leader. In his writings, Mr. Maynard said he was drawn to the topic in part because it helped him to explore the field of social deviance. His Jonestown studies focused on those suffering severe forms of narcissistic personality disorder, “when the world they have known in the past starts to spin out of their control.” In interviews, former students described Mr. Maynard as anxious, troubled and, at times, inappropriate. One said he often taught his classes during the pandemic via Zoom from a darkened bedroom, revealing details about an ailing father, a lawsuit against his former landlord and his battles with his mental health. Last year, his life appearing to unravel further, Mr. Maynard lived in his car, according to court documents. As he traversed Northern California, he sent messages to students that included rantings, as well as links to YouTube videos — meandering footage of trees and mountains — in which he ruminated on the state of the world. He also appeared fascinated by arson. Heather Williams, a federal public defender who is representing Mr. Maynard, said her team was investigating Mr. Maynard’s employment history, but she provided no other details about his personal life or a possible interest in fire. “We cannot ethically answer your questions at this time,” she wrote by email. “Something was off,” said a former student, Vamsita Venna, who took two of Mr. Maynard’s classes at Santa Clara University, where he was an adjunct faculty member from September 2019 to December 2020. Eventually, Ms. Venna and others raised concerns with professors; an employee at the university notified the police. Mr. Maynard’s contract was not renewed, the school said. What appears clear is that in the final months of Mr. Maynard’s teaching career, the boundary between his academic research and personal fascinations with fire began to blur. According to court documents, officials first came across Mr. Maynard in July when responding to a wildfire on the slopes of Mt. Shasta, about an hour south of the Oregon border. After a mountain biker called to report the fire, an investigator with the U.S. Forest Service found Mr. Maynard on a rutted road trying to extricate his car, which had gotten stuck on a boulder. Agents photographed the car and took note of the patterns of its tire tracks. When the same tracks were found near a second fire that ignited less than 24 hours later, the lead investigator obtained a warrant to track Mr. Maynard’s phone. Verizon sent coordinates for the phone’s location every 15 minutes to agents, who closely tracked his movements. When Mr. Maynard traveled to Susanville, they placed the tracker on his car. On Aug. 3, agents followed Mr. Maynard’s movements into the hills. The air was thick with smoke from the Dixie fire, a megafire burning several dozen miles away that experts believe started from electrical equipment. Mr. Maynard drove into a labyrinth of rutted dirt logging roads in the Lassen National Forest and set three additional fires, investigators say. After the third fire he was arrested. Investigators charged Mr. Maynard with setting one fire, and say he is quite likely linked with several others in July and August, all of which were caught before they could cause the devastation that other wildfires have in recent years. He has pleaded not guilty. The acting U.S. attorney who brought the charges against him argued that Mr. Maynard was “particularly dangerous, even among arsonists.” “Where Maynard went, fires started,” Phillip Talbert, the acting U.S. attorney, said in a court filing. “Not just once, but over and over again.” Advertisement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/sports/baseball/lamonte-wade-giants.html,Late Night Lamonte Leads Giants' Cast of Characters - The New York Times,"Oct. 8, 2021 5:00 p.m. ET","Advertisement Supported by National League division series To get to 107 wins, the San Francisco Giants needed everyone to step up. It can feel chaotic, but it’s all part of the plan. By Scott Miller SAN FRANCISCO — Along with a franchise-record 107 victories, and a cascading list of things that contributed to them, the San Francisco Giants have been able to fill one gaping modern-era void. In a time starved for great nicknames like Dizzy (Dean), Three-Finger (Brown) or Catfish (Hunter), the Giants have introduced “Late Night” LaMonte Wade Jr. He is neither a talk-show host nor a local television personality, but a versatile outfielder-first baseman acquired in a small, mostly unnoticed trade with Minnesota last February for pitcher Shaun Anderson. A career .211 hitter in only 95 major league at-bats coming into this season, Wade, 27, was nicknamed“Late Night” because of his propensity for ninth-inning heroics. In 336 at-bats this summer, Wade had six game-tying or go-ahead hits in the ninth inning or later. That is the most of any player in the past 40 seasons, according to Stats. It is difficult to tell who is having more fun with the nickname, Wade’s teammates or San Francisco’s fans. Certainly, his teammates are very vocal about it, both in the dugout during tense moments and in the clubhouse during moments of celebration. “Anytime the ninth inning comes around they say, ‘We’ve got to have Wade come around,’” Wade said as the Giants worked out here at Oracle Park on Thursday afternoon in preparation for Game 1 of their division series against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Friday night. It is easy to see why. He is hitting .565 in the ninth inning with a 1.409 on-base plus slugging percentage. In “late and close” situations — defined by Baseball Reference as plate appearances in the seventh inning or later with the batting team tied, ahead by one or the tying run at least on deck — Wade is batting .362 with a .444 on-base percentage and a .511 slugging percentage over 55 plate appearances. In 31 plate appearances with two out and runners in scoring position Wade is hitting .407/.484/.889 with three homers and 17 R.B.I. ‘I just want to point out, I’m pretty sure I gave him that nickname so I want credit for that.’ Brandon Belt said of Wade. “I just want to point out, I’m pretty sure I gave him that nickname so I want credit for that,” said injured first baseman Brandon Belt, who has become something of a mentor to Wade and other young Giants during the team’s run of remarkable and unexpected success this season, earning him his own nickname: “Captain Belt.” Belt explained that he was on the Giants postgame television show following one of Wade’s triumphant moments when he was given a multiple choice of nicknames for San Francisco’s newest hero. “They said ‘Late Game LaMonte,’ something else or ‘Late Night LaMonte,’ and I said that I liked Late Night,” Belt said, before adding, “It’s been a blast watching him.” Wade is the latest example of the success that Farhan Zaidi, the Giants’ president of baseball operations, has had mining the discard pile for overlooked players. One thing that caught the attention of Zaidi and his analytics staff was the plate discipline Wade exhibited even while scratching to reach the majors. Over 480 career minor league games coming into 2021, he had walked more times (303) than he had struck out (281). “Our hitting group spent a lot of time with him in the off-season and felt like there were adjustments he could make,” Zaidi said. “And I have to say when you go back, he had three home runs in his major league career coming into the season but when you look at them, they weren’t cheapies. He hit a massive home run against Shane Bieber, who was one of the best pitchers in baseball.” He continued: “You watch those swings and those home runs and you say, this guy has power, it’s just a matter of getting to it consistently.” Wade, however, is not the only secret ingredient to San Francisco’s success. Tucked into the Giants’ franchise record of 241 home runs this season was another quirky accomplishment: Their 18 pinch-hit home runs are also a major league record, and there’s not a Gates Brown (a former Tigers pinch-hitter with another excellent nickname culled when Detroit signed him out of prison), Manny Mota (the longtime pinch-hitting specialist for the Dodgers) or Lenny Harris (M.L.B.’s career pinch-hits leader with 212) in the bunch. Rather than one specialist being responsible for them, the pinch-hit homers have been spread out: Austin Slater led with four (and had only 12 homers total for the season); Alex Dickerson had three; Donovan Solano, Wilmer Flores and Belt each had two; and five other hitters had one apiece. “Shoot, it’s been really really cool,” Belt said. “It’s something we’re super proud of, especially the pinch-hit record. Pinch-hitting is not easy. It takes a special kind of person. You have to really help the team in order to do it. If you’re more worried about yourself, it’s going to be a little tougher in my opinion.” Part of the reason the Giants have so many pinch-hit homers is because there are so many opportunities. Manager Gabe Kapler firmly believes in the importance of hitter-pitcher matchups, so many positions are filled by a platoon of lefty and righty hitters. “Beyond players and coaches, you have to give Kap a lot of credit for pulling the trigger in a lot of those situations,” Zaidi said. “He kind of uses his judgment, goes with what he sees in the flow of a game but isn’t afraid to play a good matchup even if a guy has two or three hits in a game or has a homer.” Indeed, of those 18 pinch-hit homers, the pinch-hitter was replacing someone who had already homered in the game twice: Dickerson on April 1 in Seattle (batting for Slater) and Wade on Aug. 22 at Oakland (batting for Darin Ruf). “Nobody ever likes being pinch-hit for, but when a guy comes out and he’s high-fiving the guy coming in for him and he’s the most excited player on the top step when those guys come through, that’s an awesome thing to see,” Zaidi said. The Giants needed every one of their 107 wins to seize the N.L. West this year because the Dodgers won 106. Los Angeles won 70 percent of its post-All-Star break games and still finished second. One key reason is that the Giants bullpen went 16-2 in September with an M.L.B.-leading 2.38 E.R.A. Rookie Camilo Doval was recalled from Triple-A Sacramento on Sept. 5. It was his fourth recall of the season, and this time everything came together for the right-handed Doval, 24, whose 100-mile-per-hour fastball and wipeout slider elicited memories of Francisco Rodríguez when he broke into the majors and helped the Anaheim Angels beat the Giants in the 2002 World Series. Doval has settled into the closer’s role and has worked 15 and a third consecutive scoreless innings dating back to Aug. 12. That’s the fifth-longest active streak in the majors. Kapler points to Doval’s early struggles and the fact that he had to be sent down to the minors as examples of how a team can learn valuable lessons through experience. “So you can take that anecdote with Camilo Doval and expand that out across our entire roster, and many players that have been in Triple-A this year and they could share similar experiences,” Kapler said. “They’re not all perfectly analogous, but you get my point. They’re all better for having been in those moments.” Advertisement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/sports/baseball/dodgers-giants-rivalry.html,A Brief History of the Dodgers and Giants Rivalry - The New York Times,"Oct. 8, 2021Updated 5:14 p.m. ET","Advertisement Supported by The Dodgers and the Giants have been battling each other for 133 seasons. A division series between them should provide bragging rights for years to come. By Benjamin Hoffman It is a rivalry that defies description. The animosity between the Dodgers and the Giants can’t technically be described as having started as an intracity squabble. When they first played each other in 1889, the Giants hailed from Manhattan, while the Dodgers (known as the Bridegrooms at the time) were based in Brooklyn, which wouldn’t become part of New York City for another nine years. A subway series? No, that 1889 championship between the clubs was 15 years before New York City’s subway existed. To put things in (ridiculous) perspective, they had already played each other 757 times when sliced bread was invented in 1928. But however you choose to characterize their relationship, the longstanding feud will be in full force over the next week as the teams, now located in Los Angeles and San Francisco, face off in a best-of-five division series that will end the season for one of the two winningest teams in baseball this year. When considering if this is the peak of the rivalry you first have to consider some biggest moments of their relationship over the last 133 seasons (with many other tense moments left on the cutting-room floor). The first nine games between the clubs came in 1889. Brooklyn, which had been crowned champions of the American Association, agreed to face the Giants, champions of the National League, in what some referred to as the World Series. Official statistics between the clubs don’t begin until the next season, when Brooklyn joined the N.L., but the championship was taken fairly seriously. Coverage of the games in The New York Times pointed out that Arthur Dixwell, considered by many to be the most prominent baseball fan of the era, came down from Boston to celebrate the Giants beating the Bridegrooms, six games to three. “As soon as the New-Yorks won yesterday, he went to the clubhouse and presented each of the players with pretty scarfpins,” the Times reported of Dixwell. “In making the presentation he said that he admired skill, gameness, and honesty, and he felt certain that the New-York players possessed all these elements. He spoke of the drawbacks that the New-Yorks had to contend against this season, and he declared that, for various reasons, greater credit is due the Giants than if they had won under ordinary circumstances.” In January 1934, Bill Terry, the player-manager of the Giants, was asked for his thoughts on the upcoming season. Among his remarks was a quip that would come back to haunt him: “What has become of the Dodgers?” he asked. “Are they still in the league?” Terry’s Giants were terrific in the first half, but a second half collapse led to a tie with the St. Louis Cardinals going into the last two days of the season, and the Giants had to face the Dodgers twice. Fans from Brooklyn, looking to play spoilers in an otherwise disappointing season, packed the stands at the Polo Grounds and watched their Dodgers win both games, handing the pennant to St. Louis. Much was made of Terry’s comments, but Ed Hughes, a columnist for the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, defended the quote, as he believed it brought some spice to a sport that was getting bland. “Personally I think it is a sad thing for baseball there are not more bon mots and repartees of the sort,” Hughes wrote. “Of late years the game has become entirely too orderly, the thoughts and actions too prosaic and rule-of-thumb. There is a preponderance of gold, silver and paper, and not enough red blood and romance to it. The result is dullness for the fan and weakened business for the promoter.” The Dodgers were riding high, leading the National League by 13½ games on Aug. 11. But the wheels started to come off for Brooklyn, and the young Giants kept improving. The teams ended up being tied for first, necessitating a three-game tiebreaker. They split the first two games, and in the third one, Bobby Thomson, who hit 32 homers that season, crushed one of the most famous in history: The Shot Heard ’Round the World. The situation would grow complicated decades later when it was revealed that the Giants had used a complicated signal system to steal signs from other teams, but on that day in 1951, Russ Hodges, who was on the Giants’ radio broadcast, blurted out one of the most famous calls in sports broadcasting history. “There’s a long drive … it’s going to be, I believe … The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant! Bobby Thomson hits into the lower deck of the left-field stands! The Giants win the pennant and they’re going crazy! They’re going crazy! I don’t believe it! I don’t believe it! I do not believe it!” With the Dodgers frustrated by their lack of ability to build a new ballpark in Brooklyn, and the Giants struggling financially, the teams began exploring other opportunities. The league’s owners voted in May 1957 to allow them to relocate to California, provided they did so together. The Giants made their initial home at Seals Stadium, previously the home of the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League. The Dodgers went far larger, moving into the oddly configured (and cavernous) Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which set a regular season attendance record of 78,672 in the first game there — which the Dodgers played against the visiting Giants. After that first game at L.A. Memorial in 1958, the reports in The Times were positive: “The novel experiment of big league baseball in a vast stadium designed for track and football seemed an unalloyed success.” Just 11 seasons after the Shot Heard ’Round the World, the Dodgers and the Giants, firmly entrenched on the West Coast, once again had to play a three-game tiebreaker series to determine a pennant. Once again the tie in the standings came after the Dodgers faded badly down the stretch. And once again, the Giants triumphed, going ahead dramatically in the ninth inning to win Game 3 and capture the pennant. The list of parallels wouldn’t have been complete without a subsequent World Series loss to the Yankees, and the Giants delivered that as well. But not before humiliating their most fierce rivals. Arthur Daley’s Sports of the Times column did not hold back. “The ignominious crack-up of the Dodgers reached splintering force today, leaving shattered hopes behind. They had the pennant as good as won weeks ago and let themselves get tied by the Giants. They had the final playoff game as good as won in the final inning. They lost it, 6 to 4.” On Aug. 11, 1965, the Dodgers were leading the National League while the Giants were one and a half games behind them. With emotions running high, Juan Marichal and Sandy Koufax took turns throwing at star players for both teams and when Marichal came to the plate as a batter in the third inning, he fully expected Koufax to back him off the plate. Instead, it was Dodgers catcher John Roseboro who threw a ball back to Koufax in such a way that it either nicked Marichal’s ear or came close to doing so. Marichal responded, as a person holding a large piece of wood might, by walloping Roseboro over the head with it a few times. Marichal earned a hefty suspension and fine, while the Dodgers went on to win the pennant. Marichal finally explained his side of the story a few days after the incident: “First of all I want to apologize for using the bat. I am sorry I did that, but I was afraid of him.” In 1982, the Dodgers and Giants were in a fierce battle with Atlanta for the N.L. West crown, with the three teams separated by one game. A three-game series at San Francisco’s Candlestick Park proved disastrous for both teams. The Dodgers won the first two games, thus eliminating the Giants from contention, but then the Giants returned the favor, with help from Joe Morgan’s three-run homer in the eighth inning, beating the Dodgers on the season’s final day and handing the division crown to Atlanta. Morgan’s role as a spoiler was not lost on him, but the former Reds superstar had a bit more perspective than is typical in this rivalry. “I know people are going to say how the Giants live to beat the Dodgers,” he said. “That’s not the case with me. I’m not jumping up and down because we knocked the Dodgers out of the race. I’ve learned some humility in my life.” In 1993, the last year of straightforward division races before the wild card was introduced, the Giants put on a show. The season had been an endless battle with Atlanta for the N.L. West crown (side note: Atlanta was in the N.L. West), and Atlanta had made itself far stronger down the stretch by adding the slugger Fred McGriff in a midseason trade. Still, the Giants were a force to be reckoned with thanks to the sluggers Barry Bonds, Matt Williams and Will Clark. Atlanta led the division by four games on Sept. 17, but at the end of the games on Oct. 2, the second to last day of the season, the teams were tied on top. On Oct. 3, Atlanta took care of its business, beating the Colorado Rockies by 5-3. The Giants, meanwhile, were absolutely demolished by the Dodgers, who seemingly relished playing spoilers against their rivals in an ugly 12-1 game. Peter Magowan, then a co-owner of the Giants, had the line of the day when asked about the defeat coming on the 42nd anniversary of Bobby Thomson’s pennant-winning homer. “Oct. 3 is still a historic day in Giant history,” he said. “It’s just some days in history are bad days.” Advertisement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After cruising all season, the White Sox are on the brink of elimination. By Tyler Kepner HOUSTON — If you kept score at Minute Maid Park on Friday, you might have felt like a grade-school teacher with a class full of honor students, scribbling little stars onto paper all day. The Houston Astros’ defense was just that dazzling. From the first play of the game, when shortstop Carlos Correa ranged across the bag and whipped a throw on the run, to the last, when right fielder Kyle Tucker raced into foul ground for a tricky fly ball, the Astros dominated on defense. They left town with a 9-4 victory over the Chicago White Sox and a two-games-to-none lead in this best-of-five American League division series. “We preach that every single day in our clubhouse: Defense wins championships,” said Correa, who drilled a two-run double in the seventh as Chicago’s Leury Garcia twisted awkwardly in pursuit. “We take a lot of pride in that. From the moment we showed up in spring training, we said, ‘Hey, let’s try to be the No. 1 defensive team in the big leagues.’” Correa led the majors in defensive wins above replacement this season, according to Baseball Reference, improving his first step and charging slow rollers more aggressively. Overall, the Astros turned 76 percent of grounders and bunts into outs, the best ratio in the A.L. Examples were everywhere on Friday. Second baseman Jose Altuve made a diving stop with the bases loaded in the first, spinning and firing from his knees for a force at second. First baseman Yuli Gurriel speared a sharp hop in the third, stepping on the bag and tracking down a runner on the bases for an unassisted double play. On and on it went. The White Sox rapped out 11 hits, but none for extra bases for the second day in a row. They are already facing elimination after two games, an unfamiliar position for Manager Tony La Russa. In his 10 previous best-of-three playoff series, La Russa has dropped the first two games just once, in 2009, when his St. Louis Cardinals were swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers. On Friday, La Russa drew inspiration from the 2004 Boston Red Sox and their manager, Terry Francona, who recovered from a 3-0 deficit to stun the Yankees in their best-of-seven championship series. “I’ll never, ever forget, I was sitting in this town in 2004, we had an off-day and I was watching from a restaurant when Boston lost their third game,” La Russa said. “Francona said: ‘All we have to do is just win one game.’ That’s a good thing to say. It made sense.” Francona — who followed up that A.L.C.S. triumph by sweeping La Russa’s Cardinals in the World Series — now manages for Cleveland. There he won an American League pennant by using his best reliever, Andrew Miller, in high-leverage spots in the middle innings. That strategy usually worked, in part because Francona had another relief star in Cody Allen. The White Sox traded in July for the majors’ active leader in saves, Craig Kimbrel, to team with Liam Hendriks, the closer they signed for $54 million in free agency last winter. Yet Hendriks did not pitch on Friday until the game was out of reach. Aaron Bummer faced the top of the Astros’ order in the seventh and gave up three singles to four batters. The Astros led by 5-4 at that point, but Correa’s double and a homer by Kyle Tucker made it 9-4. Hendriks then pitched the eighth, his only appearance thus far in the series. “Liam had to pitch; we’re off tomorrow, he had to pitch an inning,” La Russa said. “We could have been up by 10, and he’d have pitched. Believe me, on the list of priorities, there’s a lot of stuff that was frustrating about that ballgame, and him pitching, actually, it’s one of the positives.” Fair enough; La Russa, after all, essentially reinvented bullpen roles for a generation with Oakland, and his methods helped lift him to the Hall of Fame. He has not used Hendriks before the eighth inning this season except in shorter games during doubleheaders, and the White Sox romped to the A.L. Central crown. But the Astros scored the most runs in the majors this season, and only the best pitchers seem capable of taming them. On Friday they drew five walks in four and a third innings against starter Lucas Giolito, and three of those walks became runs. They used only hits for their five-run rally in the seventh, capped by Tucker’s homer on an opposite-field drive to left. Tucker, 24, was a stealth star this season, posting the A.L.’s best on-base plus slugging percentage after June 1 at 1.000. “He’s a natural hitter; natural hitters are always the best hitters in the game,” said Correa, seated next to Tucker at a postgame news conference. “The future is bright for this kid, and not because he’s here. I’ve always told you guys he’s the most underrated player in the league. I’m glad he got this platform in the playoffs to show you how good he really is.” Tucker was in the minors in 2017, when the Astros won a World Series title widely seen as tainted by an illegal sign-stealing scam revealed in 2020. On Sunday they will play their first postseason road game with fans in the stands, but nobody seems too concerned. For now, the Astros are having too much fun to worry about being booed. When they play as they did on Friday, they’re a joy to watch.

By Alan Blinder MILWAUKEE — Corbin Burnes stood alone on the mound on Friday, a triangle of trouble already threatening to swamp the Milwaukee Brewers in a playoff game’s first inning. Jorge Soler, Atlanta’s leadoff hitter, had converted a 1-2 count into a walk. It had taken nine pitches, including a passed ball, to walk Freddie Freeman and put him and Soler on the corners. Now Atlanta’s No. 3 hitter, Ozzie Albies, swaggered toward the plate after a 30-homer regular season. Burnes’s cutter had betrayed him through the first two batters of this National League division series. He went back to it anyway. Albies swung and grounded harmlessly toward first. Soler streaked just too slowly toward home to beat a throw from Rowdy Tellez, who had already stepped on first. Four pitches (including just one cutter) later, Atlanta’s menacing, promising start had yielded nothing and Burnes was bound for the Brewers’ dugout. He would carry a no-hitter into the fifth and exit after the sixth, after striking out six and surrendering two hits and no runs. Tellez did the rest, when, with Avisail Garcia already on base in the seventh, he hammered Charlie Morton’s 95-mile-an-hour fastball some 411 feet and gave Milwaukee the only runs they would need to prevail, 2-1, in Game 1. “A lot of times, most of the big hits in the postseason, they’re homers,” Brian Snitker, Atlanta’s manager, said. “They hit one and we didn’t.” Game 2 is scheduled for Saturday in Milwaukee; the best-of-five series will move to Atlanta for up to two games starting on Monday before potentially returning to Milwaukee on Thursday for a final Game 5 showdown. On Friday, at least, no inning was more pivotal than the very first. “Postseason baseball is all about momentum,” Burnes said. “When one team gets the momentum going, it’s tough to stop that and it’s tough to kind of turn it around. So Rowdy making that play there obviously gave us the momentum, but it stopped their momentum. They had first and third, nobody out. It could have escalated quickly.” That the Brewers would win their inaugural postseason matchup against Atlanta by keeping the score low would surprise virtually no one around Milwaukee, where pitching has been a high art this year. If they wanted to contend, they hardly had a choice. The Milwaukee lineup, even with the former Most Valuable Player Award-winner Christian Yelich, managed a regular-season average that was only good for second-to-last in the N.L. The Brewers also scarcely hit for power, finishing eighth in the N.L. in regular-season home runs. But Milwaukee’s pitchers tormented rivals, throwing 19 shutouts, the most in the majors, and logging 1,618 strikeouts, also the best in baseball. Bud Selig, the former baseball commissioner and the onetime owner of the Brewers, asserted on Thursday that Milwaukee would advance “as far as pitching takes it.” Burnes, among the leading candidates for the Cy Young Award, has been the centerpiece — if one who was deeply vulnerable at first on Friday, when, he said, he could only cycle through his pitches in search of something, anything, that could get an out. He solved his problems faster than Atlanta did its. “You love to get to a pitcher like that early before he gets settled in, because they get out of an inning like that and things happen like it did,” Snitker said. Morton, with a fooling curveball and a record of postseason prestige, hardly had a poor showing. Tellez’s home run was one of three hits he allowed on Friday, when he struck out nine over six innings. Atlanta’s mighty offense — the club was one of the most power-prone in the league this season — simply sputtered before a partisan crowd and a series of pitchers who made only fleeting mistakes. Still, Milwaukee’s offensive impotence gave Atlanta just enough room to make a last stand in the ninth, when it returned to the corners. With two outs already, it proved too late. Josh Hader, the Milwaukee closer, forced Orlando Arcia, who had been a Brewer until April, into a groundout. In the stadium’s concourse afterward, a roar swelled, a chant rooted in the first inning and cemented in the seventh, all directed toward a player who had arrived in Milwaukee just in July. “Rowdy! Rowdy! Rowdy!” Advertisement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

19,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/opinion/instagram-teen-girls-mental-health.html,"Opinion | For Teen Girls, Instagram Is a Cesspool - The New York Times","Oct. 8, 2021","Advertisement Supported by Lindsay crouse By Lindsay Crouse Ms. Crouse is an Opinion writer and producer who focuses on gender and power. When Frances Haugen, a former product manager at Facebook, told a Senate hearing this week that the company put its “astronomical profits before people,” the outcry was loud and indignant. The social media company’s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, responded with a Facebook post insisting, “We care deeply about issues like safety, well-being and mental health.” But the whistle-blower was citing the company’s own research, which among other things found that, based on surveys, “Thirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse,” as The Wall Street Journal reported. (Ms. Haugen provided internal documents to The Journal from Facebook, which owns Instagram.) What exactly are we talking about here? Say you’re a 13-year-old girl who is beginning to feel anxious about your appearance, who has followed some diet influencers online. Instagram’s algorithm might suggest more extreme dieting accounts with names such as “Eternally starved,” “I have to be thin” and “I want to be perfect.” In an interview with “60 Minutes,” Ms. Haugen called this “tragic.” “As these young women begin to consume this eating disorder content, they get more and more depressed,” she said. “It actually makes them use the app more. And so they end up in this feedback cycle where they hate their bodies more and more.” Anyone who has ever spent time as a teenage girl is unlikely to find any of these revelations particularly surprising. Facebook and Instagram are simply carrying on a longstanding American tradition: stoking the insecurities of teenage girls to cash in on them. There’s plenty of cash at stake here. The global beauty industry generates $500 billion in annual sales, and social media is now an important driver, especially for the youngest target demographic, Gen Z. The global weight management market was estimated at more than $260 billion in 2020, and is projected to grow to more than $400 billion by 2027. For girls in America, taking in content that seems intended to make you hate your body is an adolescent rite of passage. The medium changes but the ritual stays the same. Before American girls’ confidence was commodified by Instagram, it was at the whim of magazines filled with impossibly slender, airbrushed models and ads from industries relying on girls and women for revenue. At the core of this marketing, the message endures: You are riddled with flaws and imperfections. We will tell you what to buy, and what do, to fix yourself. It’s scary how much these messages can stick with you. I haven’t been a teenager for nearly two decades, but I vividly remember the advice in the teen magazines I brought home from the library and studied like my textbooks: Celery is “negative calories” (whatever that means). If you succumb to dessert, for the love of God, make it fat-free. I read once that if I was still hungry, I might try eating ice. I can still look at a plate of food and instantly assign it a number of calories in my mind. The advice of how to look and be your best often came dressed up in language of empowerment — and it wasn’t wrong about what it took to succeed in a sexist, appearances-driven society. If magazines left girls with the distinct impression that our bodies and faces were being constantly appraised, assessed and compared, that impression was confirmed by our experiences in the world. Mark Zuckerberg participated in the ritual of ranking girls too. When he was experimenting before building Facebook, as a student at Harvard, he put his female classmates’ photos on his now-notorious “Facemash” website, where students could rank and compare the students’ headshots based on how hot they were. He wrote at the time, “I almost want to put some of these faces next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on which is more attractive.” For girls now, things have changed. They’re largely worse. Social media platforms such as Instagram feel like algorithmic free-for-alls, full of images of people who have altered how they look, whether by using online filters or in real life, with dieting, surgery or both. In the feed, influencers’ and celebrities’ photos are interspersed with photos of your friends and yourself. Now any photo is subject to scrutiny, comparison and assessment in the form of likes and comments. To some extent, the way these dynamics play out on Instagram is just a natural extension of how girls are treated in our culture anyway. The body positivity movement may have helped, but girls still internalize the message that part of their success in life will rest upon their ability to be admired for their appearance. Instagram measures and gamifies that — creating a virtual high school cafeteria as global as the “explore” button, one that’s peopled by countless unreal bodies. <U+200B><U+200B> (Adults aren’t exempt — they are more likely to consider plastic surgery if they frequently use image-heavy social media platforms like Instagram.) Many of these messages are conveyed under the guise of health or wellness, but Facebook’s leaked research suggests that this charade does less to promote health than to damage it. No school health class or parental reassurance is a match for the might of these powerful tech platforms, combined with entire industries that prey on girls’ insecurities. Girls themselves often know Instagram is not good for them, but they keep coming back. That’s because social media is addictive. Writing in The Atlantic, Derek Thompson called it “attention alcohol,” explaining, “Like booze, social media seems to offer an intoxicating cocktail of dopamine, disorientation, and, for some, dependency.” We are supposed to protect minors from products like this, not dish it out. For his part, Mr. Zuckerberg isn’t ranking girls in public anymore. Instead, he is the father of daughters. Citing his perspective as a parent, Mr. Zuckerberg pledged in his Facebook post his commitment to continuing to research and prioritize the welfare of children, framing their exposure to his products as inevitable. “The reality is that young people use technology,” he wrote. “Rather than ignoring this, technology companies should build experiences that meet their needs while also keeping them safe.” But more telling than what Silicon Valley parents say is what they do. Many of them have long known that technology can be harmful: That’s why they’ve often banned their own children from using it. Ultimately, Instagram is just a vicious messenger. But the cesspool of content fueling it? That comes from us. Lindsay Crouse (@lindsaycrouse) is a writer and producer in Opinion.

20,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/opinion/tech-jobs-tesla.html,Opinion | Tech Jobs Are Everywhere Now - The New York Times,"Oct. 8, 2021 3:05 p.m. ET","Advertisement Supported by Peter Coy By Peter Coy Opinion Writer Just two years ago the metropolitan areas that serve as the nation’s technology hubs seemed to be sucking tech jobs away from other parts of the country. A Brookings Institution report in December 2019 noted that just five cities — Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle and San Jose, Calif. — accounted for more than 90 percent of employment growth in the innovation sector from 2005 to 2017. The trend is now in the other direction: The tech hubs’ share of employment is falling. This development was already starting in 2019, and the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated it. Newspapers are full of stories about Silicon Valley tech workers moving to parts of the country where the housing is cheaper and the fishing is better. Yesterday, Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, announced at the annual shareholder meeting that the company will move its headquarters from Palo Alto, Calif., to Austin, Texas. Employers seem to be benefiting from the trend: Mark Muro, a Brookings senior fellow, told The Wall Street Journal in July that tech companies, by letting people work outside their home offices, can “truly access lost Einsteins all across the country.” The evidence for this shift used to be mostly anecdotal. Now there’s hard data. It comes from the Conference Board, a business-supported research organization. Gad Levanon, the founder of the board’s Labor Market Institute, gave me a preview of data he has collected using software that tracks almost all the online want ads in the United States. He focused on ads placed by tech employers based in five tech hubs — the same five as those surveyed by Brookings in 2019, except with Los Angeles in place of Boston. His findings? “West Coast tech companies are dramatically shifting their hiring to other parts of the U.S.,” Levanon wrote to me in an email. “Not just for tech jobs, but also engineers, scientists, managers, business and financial professionals.” That’s evident in this chart: Levanon also analyzed the data according to where new jobs are being offered. “They are moving to all over the place,” he wrote me. Some of the jobs, he explained, are in metropolitan areas where the employers were already established — such as New York, Washington, Boston and Austin, Texas. “But some of the shift,” he said, “is to areas where they barely hired before” — like Boise, Idaho, and Des Moines, Iowa. Here’s another chart I created from Levanon’s data: Because of the pandemic, employers have gotten more comfortable with hiring people who don’t work at their companies’ headquarters, Levanon says. Some new hires may be working at home while others are in satellite offices. Casting the net wider gives companies access to more talent — including people who may work for lower salaries because their living costs are cheaper elsewhere. In addition, Levanon says, the hiring dispersion may increase racial diversity, long a weak point of the tech sector. “Expanding their hiring to areas where there is a stronger concentration of people of color can help increase the representation in high-paying jobs, especially for Black workers,” he wrote. It occurs to me that there’s perhaps an even simpler solution to the debt ceiling problem than the trillion-dollar platinum coin: Have the Fed issue a cryptocurrency, sell it off in an initial coin offering and use the proceeds to fund the government. Seems to me to be exactly the same. David Director Media, Penn. “Our objective is not to inflame trade tensions with China. Durable coexistence requires accountability and respect for the enormous consequences of our actions. I am committed to working through the many challenges ahead in this bilateral process in order to deliver meaningful results. But above all else, we must defend to the hilt our economic interests.” — Katherine Tai, the U.S. trade representative, in a speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Oct. 4 Have feedback?

By Jason Horowitz ROME — Romans ran laps around Lamont Marcell Jacobs as he stretched his legs on the track. “Ciao champion,” said one speed walker. “You make us old guys dream,” said one of the old guys. Mr. Jacobs bobbed his head to the trap music pumping out of a portable speaker and sauntered up to the starting line. Then he took a calming breath, crouched and exploded, running faster than anyone on the track, anyone in Italy — almost anyone on Earth. At the Tokyo Olympics, Mr. Jacobs, a little-known Italian when the Games began, stunned the sports world by winning gold in the men’s 100-meter dash. In a nation where some populist politicians have courted support by demonizing Black migrants, the victory by the son of a Black American father and white Italian mother broadened the public imagination of what Italian athletes, and Italians, can look like. Mr. Jacobs’s chiseled chin and clean-shaved dome became the new face of Italian excellence in a year with an abundance of it. Italy had a record haul at the Olympics, 40 medals, including 10 in track and field. “All golds,” said Mr. Jacobs, who had two of them in his backpack. Prime Minister Mario Draghi has received a steady stream of Italian champions and award winners in recent months. The national soccer team beat England in July to win the European soccer championship. An Italian reached the men’s final at Wimbledon. A Roman band won the Eurovision song contest. Italy’s men’s and women’s volleyball teams won the European championships. In the days before Mr. Jacobs hit the track, Italy took home the World Pastry Cup. This week, an Italian won a Nobel Prize in Physics. “Seeing the others win automatically gives you a will to win,” said Mr. Jacobs, 27, who is languid when not running a 9.8-second 100-meter. After the sprinter won his race, Gianmarco Tamberi, who had just won gold in the high jump, leapt into his arms. Their embrace with the Italian flag became emblematic of Italian achievement, and social progress. “Italians all remember it,” Mr. Jacobs said. In the ensuing months, he has taken a break and received gifts and many paintings of him running. (“Now a statue is coming, I don’t know what to do.”) He is in negotiations for endorsements but reluctantly turned down a suborbital flight with Virgin because “in space no one knows how the body changes.” He has also focused on maintaining 700,000 new followers of his Instagram account. “It’s not like a job,” he said with exasperation after posting another picture of himself at the track. “It is a job.” A significant portion of Mr. Jacobs’s social media output consists of photos of him looking model-serious or showing off a ripped torso abundantly tattooed with his children’s names and birth dates, inspirational phrases, a tiger and a Roman gladiator. Other posts include risqué Jacuzzi shots with Nicole Daza, the mother of two of his three children. He recently proposed marriage to her with a fireworks display and is looking forward to “a multiethnic wedding” with her Ecuadorean family at Lake Garda. But some critics have tried to cut Mr. Jacobs’s Olympic honeymoon short by doubting he will ever race again. The British media, suspicious of his dipping under the 10-second mark only this year, have leveled accusations of doping. He chalked it up to sour grapes after Italy won the soccer championship, and then he and his teammates beat the British by a nose in the 400-meter relay. Britain “lost everything,” he said with a shrug and joked about the British announcer who memorably screamed “No! It’s Italy” at the 400-meter finish line. That a member of Britain’s own relay team tested positive for doping “makes you laugh,” he said. Nevertheless, the accusations saddened him, he said, because they undercut years of hard work and sacrifice. “They don’t know my past,” he said. In Mr. Jacobs’s telling, it wasn’t a foreign substance that pushed him forward but domestic baggage that had held him back. He explained his sudden burst into the upper echelon of elite sprinters as a result of hiring a mental coach, Nicoletta Romanazzi, at the end of 2020. She convinced him, he said, that to get over the tension that deadened his legs before races, he had to build a relationship with the father who vanished in his infancy. They eventually had some phone conversations and exchanged text messages. “Because I was abandoned as a little boy, I feared that if I didn’t do things right, people could abandon me,” he said, adding that the fear of failure paralyzed him. “She talked to me constantly about this abandonment thing.” His parents were teenagers when they met at an American military base in the northern city of Vicenza, where his father was posted. They moved to a base in El Paso, Texas, where Mr. Jacobs was born. The father was sent to South Korea. Mr. Jacobs’s mother returned to Desenzano del Garda, a vacation town in northern Italy, expecting the couple to reunite there. “He disappeared,” Mr. Jacobs said of his father. Raised as an Italian, Mr. Jacobs spoke no English and spent hours with his grandparents. His mother started a cleaning service before opening a small hotel, where she watched him win the gold. (“Incredible,” she said in front of a makeshift shrine to her son. “To get a gold like this, beating all the Americans.”) Mr. Jacobs’s cousins were obsessed with motorbike racing when they were young, but he just made motor sounds with his mouth as he ran around. “The human little motorbike,” his grandfather called him. “I ran all the time,” Mr. Jacobs said. “Always.” At 7, he became aware of his speed, but also his skin color, and asked his mother if he was adopted. To better explain his origins, she had his father’s mother come visit. When he was 13, he and his mother attended an American family reunion in Orlando, where he met his father for the first time. He also attended barbecues and stared blankly at his American cousins, not understanding a word they said except that they called him a “mama’s boy.” While he rarely felt any direct prejudice in Italy, he returned more sensitive to the disparaging way some people talked about African migrants around town. It still bothers him that one of his teammates in the 400-meter relay, Fausto Desalu, the son of a Nigerian single mother who looks after Italian senior citizens, could not become a citizen until age 18. “Born and raised in Italy,” Mr. Jacobs said of his teammate, criticizing a law that ties citizenship to blood rather than birthplace. He hoped the team’s success would change something. “Often,” he said, “sport helps.” Sports certainly helped him. A terrible student, often reprimanded by the priests who now ask him to talk to students (“Noooo,” he said, “no, no”), he was discovered by a local athletics coach. He became a long jumper under the wing of another coach who became a father figure, but had quirky training methods. He made Mr. Jacobs run with Nordic walking sticks on the track and up corridors of vineyards in Garda. “He had some strange ideas,” Mr. Jacobs said. By 20, Mr. Jacobs had become a police officer, though he was never expected to chase down criminals. Italy’s law enforcement agencies employ the country’s athletic talent, giving them salaries, training facilities — and weapons. “I have a gun and handcuffs and a badge,” he said, pulling the badge issued in 2014 out of his bag and admiring his now-extinct curly hair on his police ID. He is still an officer and noted that he was now due for a promotion. “Having won the Olympics,” he said, “they give you another rank.” Frustrated with his injuries and lackluster results, his superiors in the police connected him late 2015 with Paolo Camossi, a former world champion in the triple jump, and a member of the prison police. “I arrest them, he puts them in jail,” Mr. Jacobs joked on the track as Mr. Camossi timed his sprints and gave him pointers. They trained hard, went through many ups and downs and ultimately switched him from the long jump to sprints, and this year, he started setting personal bests. By the time the Tokyo games rolled around, something clicked and Italy had a new hero. “We’re proud,” said Ennio Rossi, 79, who walked briskly by Mr. Jacobs on the track “to train with the world’s fastest man.” Advertisement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/style/homer-simpson-fashion.html,Homer Simpson Was Made for Fashion - The New York Times,"Oct. 8, 2021Updated 5:06 p.m. ET","Advertisement Supported by Behind the painstaking creation of the Balenciaga-Simpsons episode that took nearly a year to make. By Jessica Testa Clapping, whispering, cameras snapping, questionable music: These are the sounds of a classic fashion show. Bursts of laughter? Those are less common. Yet several were heard last Saturday night, rolling around the 19th-century Parisian theater where the great and storied house of Cristóbal Balenciaga skipped the traditional catwalk and screened a special 10-minute episode of “The Simpsons.” It was a surprise more than a year in the making, and the result of a sometimes grueling collaboration between two exacting creative entities known for their attention to detail. So far it has been viewed more than five million times on YouTube. In the episode, Homer writes to Balenciaga (“Dear Balun, Balloon, Baleen, Balenciaga-ga,” he says as he struggles to pronounce the famous fashion name) for Marge’s birthday, explaining that his wife has always wanted to own something by the brand.  He asks for the cheapest item, which the Balenciaga team interprets as “just one of those American gags nobody gets” and sends him a dress that costs 19,000 euros. After wearing it briefly, Marge returns the dress with a note saying she’ll “always remember those 30 minutes of feeling just a little special.” Back in Europe, the Balenciaga artistic director Demna Gvasalia declares her note “the saddest thing I’ve ever heard, and I grew up in the Soviet Union. This is exactly the kind of woman I want to reach!” He then travels to Springfield and decides to “rescue” the “style-deprived” by inviting them to model his clothes in Paris, explaining that he wants “the world to see real people in my show.” The 10 minutes are packed with Easter eggs for die-hard fans of both “The Simpsons” and Balenciaga. A private Balenciaga jet has landing gear that looks like the brand’s famous sock sneakers; Waylon Smithers chooses a dress to wear when given his choice of outfit; Lisa at first acknowledges that walking a runway is “superficial” but then enjoys it immensely. The collaboration began in April 2020, when Mr. Gvasalia sent the “Simpsons” creator Matt Groening an email about working together. Mr. Gvasalia, 40, who was born in Georgia and watched the show when he was growing up, said the idea came to him during the first lockdown of 2020. He has a penchant for inserting Balenciaga into mass-market trends: Under his direction, the brand has collaborated with other American sensations, like Crocs and Fortnite. About “The Simpsons,” he said, “I always loved the tongue-in-cheek humor, the romance and the charming naïveness of it.” Al Jean, an executive producer and writer of “The Simpsons,” said that when he learned of the Balenciaga project in January, “my response was, ‘What’s Balenciaga?’” He turned to Wikipedia for answers. His first pitch to Balenciaga had a similar framing to the one they ended up going with — Marge’s birthday wish — but diverged with Mr. Gvasalia’s character deciding that the brand’s next show would be held in Springfield. When the Balenciaga plane lands there, its models aren’t allowed into the United States because they’re too thin and beautiful. Springfield’s residents become the models, their nuclear plant is the runway, and the ghost of Mr. Balenciaga makes an appearance. But Balenciaga preferred that Springfield be brought to Paris, Mr. Jean said. From there, the story was revised and tweaked — to the point that the writers joked about “Draft 52 of the Balenciaga script” — up until two days before the Paris showing. Mr. Gvasalia made specific contributions to the script, Mr. Jean said. For example, the episode ends with Homer embracing and singing “La Mer” to Marge on a post-show party boat on the Seine. But Mr. Gvasalia wanted one final joke, so he asked that Homer’s jacket be set on fire by a Frenchman smoking a cigar. Mr. Jean then suggested that Anna Wintour, who had appeared in the front row of the fashion show, try to put out the fire with expensive champagne, which Homer tries to drink instead. “She said, ‘Please don’t have me do that,’ so it became Demna,” Mr. Jean said. (Ms. Wintour otherwise approved of her likeness being used but declined to voice her character, he said.) And that earlier line about Mr. Gvasalia growing up in the Soviet Union? The “Simpsons” team had decided to cut it, but Mr. Gvasalia asked for it to be reinstated. He also asked, the day before the show, to change the color of a tear Ms. Wintour sheds while watching Marge model. The tear was too light, and it wouldn’t read onscreen unless it was a darker blue. Mr. Jean and the director David Silverman agreed. “They were definitely our match in terms of, to the last detail, making sure everything is perfect,” Mr. Jean said. “The animation crew, this is the hardest thing they’ve had to do since ‘The Simpsons Movie.’” Mr. Silverman, who directed that 2007 film, said the biggest challenge was getting the “accuracy needed in the clothing,” which involved inventive post-animation effects to capture the distinct textures and movement of, for example, Marge’s runway look: a gold metallic ball gown. Balenciaga sent the “Simpsons” team 15 looks to choose from for the final show, all based on designs from the last five years. But putting them on the bodies of these universally recognizable cartoon characters wasn’t so straightforward. “It was tricky for us, capturing that balance of caricature and the integrity of the clothing,” Mr. Silverman said. “You’re translating the look of real clothing, real designs on these characters that aren’t exactly human proportions.” Mr. Silverman, who joked-but-not-really that this is how he spent his summer vacation, studied runway footage to figure out what the audience should be wearing and how the lighting should be hitting the catwalk. The script also had to capture the particular absurdity of the luxury fashion world and Balenciaga’s stature in that world — something that can’t be absorbed on Wikipedia. Mr. Jean said that in addition to the crash course in Balenciaga earlier in the year, watching the Netflix series about Halston, who was a great fan of Balenciaga, helped him understand the evergreen excessive culture of fashion. The supporting characters are also based on real people and animals, including Mr. Gvasalia’s husband, Loïk Gomez; their two dogs; the chief creative officer, Martina Tiefenthaler (who voiced herself); and workers from Balenciaga’s atelier who are finishing the collection on the plane while singing, “formidable, formidable.” This is one of Mr. Gvasalia’s favorite scenes in the episode, he said: “It just makes me so happy every time I watch it.” As for Mr. Gvasalia’s voice, “we had to try to talk him into playing himself, but he didn’t want to,” Mr. Jean said. He felt that was consistent with Mr. Gvasalia’s recent decision to fully obscure his face and body during public appearances, creating confusion among observers as to whether it was really him. When asked why he wanted to align Balenciaga with “The Simpsons” and whether he felt the brands had any commonalities, Mr. Gvasalia said that “it’s more personal to me.” “I did not want to align anything or make sense of anything. I just wanted to create an iconic visual story.” While the novelty of the collaboration made it feel surprising, the brands share a similar ethos. They have an appreciation for self-referentiality, breaking the rules of presentation (airing an episode with live animation; turning a red carpet into a runway show without telling anyone) and bridging the highbrow and lowbrow. Mr. Jean called Mr. Gvasalia an “excellent collaborator,” and Mr. Gvasalia described the experience as “the highest level of collaboration” and “a dream come true.” “I did not realize how complex it is to create a 10-minute-long episode, so huge respect to that,” he said. Whether the act was meant to challenge fashion’s self-seriousness or the public’s notions of luxury — to bring Balenciaga to the suburban masses or to bring the suburban masses to Balenciaga — is something he will let the critics debate. What did he want out of this? “A smile and a good dose of fun.” Advertisement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/movies/memoria-release-moviegoing.html,Is Moviegoing Undemocratic? - The New York Times,"Oct. 6, 2021","Advertisement Supported by Critic’s Notebook The plan to distribute the art-house film “Memoria” in one theater at a time has set off a heated debate over whether the idea is elitist or inspired. By A.O. Scott I saw “Memoria” during the New York Film Festival, projected on a screen in a room somewhere other than my house. It’s a strange, captivating movie, graceful and elusive, with a distinctive pedigree. Starring Tilda Swinton and directed by Apichatpong Weerasethakul, who is from Thailand, “Memoria” was shot in Colombia and will be that country’s official selection for the Academy Awards. At once emotionally resonant and tricky to describe, it’s the kind of challenging movie that critics embrace in the hope that it might find an audience beyond the festival circuit. It will have that chance, though not in the usual way. On Tuesday, Neon — the art-house distributor that brought the Cannes prizewinners “Parasite” and “Titane” to North American moviegoers — announced plans to release “Memoria” later this year. As first reported in IndieWire, Neon will open the film in New York in December, after which it will move “from city to city, theater to theater, week by week, playing in front of only one solitary audience at any given time.” No itinerary has yet been released, but one place you will not be able to see Weerasethakul’s movie is in your living room. According to IndieWire, “it will not become available on DVD, on demand, or streaming platforms.” Never? I suspect there will be a Criterion Blu-ray one of these days. In the meantime, Neon’s news caused a predictable kerfuffle on film Twitter, whose denizens like nothing better than a heated argument about a movie very few people have seen. The set-to in this case was between those who applauded the “Memoria” strategy as a defense of the aesthetic superiority of going to the movies and those who scorned it as elitist and exclusionary. Here we go again. In general, I take a noncombatant position in the streaming wars. I’m in favor of people seeing movies in the best possible conditions, and I’m aware that sometimes those conditions will be fulfilled on the home screen. If you can’t make it to the cinema, the cinema can come to you. Clear sound, full screen — can’t lose. I also think that the terms of the streaming vs. theater debate are misguided. How is it that a quintessentially democratic cultural activity — buying a ticket and some popcorn and finding a seat in the dark — has been reclassified as a snobbish, specialized fetish? The answer, I think, is a form of pseudo-populist techno-triumphalism that takes what seems to be the easiest mode of consumption as, by definition, the most progressive. Loyalty to older ways of doing things looks at best quaint, at worst reactionary and in any case irrational. Why wouldn’t you put your movie out there where everyone could see it? Everyone, that is, who subscribes to a given streaming platform or pays retail for video on demand. Netflix is not a public utility. Furthermore, the universal accessibility that is part of the ideology of streaming looks in practice more like a kind of invisibility. If you can watch a given movie whenever you want, you never have to watch it at all. Or you can pause after a few minutes, check out something else and maybe come back the next night. A partially read book can shame you from the night stand, but an unstreamed movie drifts alone in the ether. That is the fate “Memoria” is resisting. As an object and an experience, it resists the rhythms of home viewing to begin with. Swinton’s character, an expatriate named Jessica, seems literally lost in space and time, experiencing the world in a way that alienates her from other people and her own consciousness. She hears noises inaudible to anyone else and finds companions who may not exist. We don’t know if the explanation is psychological or supernatural, or whether Weerasethakul is dabbling in science fiction, metaphysics or some of each. What we do know is that the streets of Bogotá and the lush slopes of the Andes look beautiful in 35 millimeter, and that the sounds and images cast a delicate spell. The magic may require a theatrical setting. Abstract, slow-moving films that aren’t propelled by dialogue or plot don’t lend themselves naturally to couch-bound, distraction-prone viewing. Weird movies are best seen in the company of strangers. Did you see what I saw? What was it, anyway? The algorithm won’t help you. “Memoria” is hardly alone in demanding a different kind of attention, and it’s unlikely that the week-by-week, one-theater-at-a-time release strategy will become a widespread business model. But there is something beautiful, even utopian in the idea that another way of looking is possible, that habits can be broken. That we might have to go find movies out in the world, where they are looking for us.

24,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/briefing/jobs-nobel-peace-prize-mlb-playoffs.html,"Jobs, Nobel Peace Prize, M.L.B. Playoffs: Your Friday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","Oct. 8, 2021  5:46 p.m. ET","Advertisement Supported by Here’s what you need to know at the end of the day. By Remy Tumin (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.)  Good evening. Here’s the latest at the end of Friday. 1. The latest coronavirus wave led to a second straight month of disappointing job growth.    Employers added just 194,000 jobs in September, down from 366,000 in August and far below the increase of more than one million in July. The data from the Labor Department was collected in mid-September, when the Delta wave was near its peak. Since then, cases and hospitalizations have fallen in much of the country, and more timely data from private-sector sources suggests that economic activity has begun to rebound. It’s not as bad as it looks, our senior economics correspondent writes. The jobs numbers actually reflect a steady expansion that is more rapid than other recent recoveries. Nonetheless, the slowdown shows the economy’s continued vulnerability to the pandemic, raising the stakes for the Federal Reserve as it balances inflation with missing jobs. In other economic news, more than 130 countries agreed to an overhaul of international tax rules, with officials backing a 15 percent global minimum tax. The new rules, after years of negotiations, are aimed at cracking down on tax havens.  2. The good news: The national outlook on the coronavirus has improved considerably in recent weeks. The bad news: Winter is coming.      A surge driven by the Delta variant is receding in the U.S., but officials and experts say that increased transmission during the coming colder months remains a threat and that steady rates of vaccination are key to keeping the coronavirus at bay. About 56 percent of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated. As cold weather pushes many people indoors, the next few months will be critical, one infectious disease expert said, but the combination of increased vaccinations and natural immunity from infections could prevent another catastrophic wave like the one that struck the U.S. last year. 3. The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to two journalists for their efforts in the fight for freedom of expression.     Maria Ressa of the Philippines and Dmitri Muratov of Russia “are representatives of all journalists who stand up for this ideal in a world in which democracy and freedom of the press face increasingly adverse conditions,” the Nobel committee said.  Ressa is the co-founder of Rappler, an independent news site that has exposed government corruption under Rodrigo Duterte, her country’s authoritarian president. She is only the 18th woman to win the peace prize. Muratov, the editor in chief of Novaya Gazeta, said his prize was a posthumous recognition of the six journalists who had worked with the newspaper and been killed. Muratov said he would have given the honor to a different Russian: Aleksei Navalny. 4. Two parents were convicted in the Varsity Blues college admissions scandal, which ensnared over 50 teachers, coaches and officials.    John Wilson, a private equity financier, and Gamal Abdelaziz, a former casino executive, were the first people to stand trial in the federal investigation, which uncovered a scheme by wealthy parents to have their children fraudulently admitted as athletic recruits to some of the most prestigious universities in the country. Many other parents, including some celebrities, have pleaded guilty rather than take their chances in court. Abdelaziz was accused of paying $300,000 to have his daughter admitted to U.S.C. as a top-ranked basketball recruit. Wilson was accused of paying $220,000 to have his son admitted as a water polo recruit at U.S.C. and of agreeing to pay $1.5 million to have his twin daughters, who were good students, admitted to Harvard and Stanford as recruited athletes. 5. An Islamic State suicide bomber killed dozens of worshipers who had gathered for Friday Prayer at a Shiite mosque in Afghanistan.    The massacre was the group’s second attack against a mosque in just a few days. It confirmed that a campaign of violence targeting Afghanistan’s Hazara Shiite minority would go unchecked under the Taliban, which have also preyed on the Hazara in the past. A local Shiite community leader said that more than 70 people were killed in the attack. The Islamic State Khorasan, the same group that carried out the suicide bombing at the international airport in Kabul on Aug. 26, took responsibility for the attack that took place in Kunduz.  6. Arson is surging in Northern California, an area where a match stick can be an especially powerful weapon.     Last year, the number of wildland arson fires in California rose by 6 percent, from 301 to 320. Over the past two months, three people suspected of arson in Northern California have been considered responsible for fires that burned thousands of acres and destroyed more than 200 homes and businesses. Among them are a criminology professor and a yoga instructor. We’re tracking the wildfires and air quality in Western states. 7. October baseball is in full swing.     In the American League, the Tampa Bay Rays are a game ahead of the Boston Red Sox as they head into their second division series game tonight; the Houston Astros and the Chicago White Sox are playing Game 2. Tony La Russa, the White Sox manager, and Dusty Baker, the Astros manager, have crossed paths for decades — as teammates, as manager and player, and as rivals. Now they’re facing off yet again. In the National League, the Atlanta Braves play the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 tonight (read about how the former M.L.B. Commissioner Bud Selig is a Milwaukee superfan). Then it’s on to the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants. The two California teams have been battling each other for 133 seasons. A division series between them should provide bragging rights for years to come.  8. This image of the roiling sea is from thousands of photographs.    Since 2003, Sohei Nishino has made more than 20 diorama maps, as he calls them, of cities around the world. Each one required the same kind of weekslong roving residency, followed by weeks spent of arduously assembling images into panoramas. In lockdown, Nishino took on a radically new subject: the waves near his home in Mishima, Japan. See how it came together. If you’re in New York City, our art critic recommends bringing a fine eye to a rehang of celebrated Chinese landscapes at the Met.   9. Before the hamburger, there was the hamburger steak.       Our Food columnist Eric Kim talked to the owner of Pie ’n Burger, where the prime ground beef patty has been on the menu for decades. The hamburger steak plate comes with a salad, hash browns and a toasted bun. Eric then came up with his own version that delivers a kind of nostalgic comfort.  Eating the ingredients separately, he writes, “lets you appreciate each part — a chance to truly relish what makes a burger great.” For our Canadian readers celebrating Thanksgiving on Monday, here are 11 delicious ways to celebrate being together again.  10. And finally, when you go to the loo, a bat might go boo.    In Tanzania, the spaces under certain pit latrines have become cozy havens for roosting bats.  A new study found that pit toilets have everything a bat could want: moist air, warm and temperature-controlled conditions, and protection from predators that cannot crawl through the drop hole. Leejiah Dorward, a postdoctoral researcher at Bangor University in Wales, began to survey the pit toilets in 2017, using a precarious photography method. He later taped a small mirror and flashlight to angled aluminum rods, allowing him to count all the bats, which clung to the wooden bars that held up the concrete slab covering the hole. His suspicions were confirmed — the older the latrine, the more bats to be found. Have a cozy weekend. David Poller compiled photos for this briefing.

This weekend, listen to a collection of narrated articles from around The New York Times, read aloud by the reporters who wrote them. Written and narrated by Ligaya Mishan The box jellyfish has no armor, only delicate trailing tentacles studded with tiny tubes filled with venom. This shares some of the same lethal proteins deployed by snakes and spiders, as well as a toxin that perforates cells and lets potassium seep into the blood, which can quickly swamp the body and stop the heart.  Yet in parts of Asia, fishermen pluck box jellyfish straight from the shallows with their bare hands, then carefully pinch off the tentacles and fling them away. What’s left is rinsed, then bathed in vinegar or lime juice. It may be chopped with chiles or eaten whole on the spot. This isn’t necessarily an act of daring or machismo: Jellyfish is a traditional food in the East. Nevertheless, it can be framed as such for outsiders seeking an exotic thrill. For culinary tourists, eating an animal that could kill you can be a kind of flex — a show of power. Part of the fear and the desire to dominate comes from confronting anatomy that in no way resembles our own. Written by Ryan Mac and Cecilia Kang | Narrated by Ryan Mac  In an interview with “60 Minutes” that aired earlier this month, Frances Haugen revealed herself to be the whistle-blower against Facebook.  A product manager who worked for nearly two years on the civic misinformation team at the social network before leaving in May, Ms. Haugen has used the documents she amassed to expose how much Facebook knew about the harms that it was causing and provided the evidence to lawmakers, regulators and the news media. “I’ve seen a bunch of social networks and it was substantially worse at Facebook than what I had seen before,” Ms. Haugen said in the interview. She added, “Facebook, over and over again, has shown it chooses profit over safety.” Written and narrated by Priya Krishna It was a tweet heard round the internet. Two images, side by side: two regal blue Royal Dansk tins, filled with sugar-studded butter cookies slotted in white wrappers, next to an identical tin with a much less enticing assortment of buttons and thread. Written beneath the first image, “My fall plans.” Under the second, “The Delta variant.” The tweet in August, which followed a popular meme about pandemic disappointment, drew more than half a million likes and 75,000 retweets. Its author, the film critic Carlos Aguilar, was surprised to find that he had hit on a seemingly universal experience: the repurposing of a Royal Dansk tin as a sewing kit, and the dismay of all of the children who’ve opened one. Food can inspire strong emotions. And sometimes the container it came in can evoke an even stronger response. Royal Dansk tins, Cool Whip tubs, Dannon yogurt containers and Bonne Maman jam jars all belong to an unofficial hall of fame of receptacles that have been redeployed for a myriad uses, giving them countless afterlives and often imbuing them with special meaning that transcends whatever they contained in the first place. Written and narrated by Pam Belluck Driving home from work in Northern California five years ago, Sarah was so overwhelmed with depression that all she could think about was ending her life. She tried nearly every treatment, but as with nearly a third of the more than 250 million people with depression worldwide, her symptoms persisted. Then Sarah became the first participant in an unusual study of an experimental therapy. Researchers surgically implanted a battery-operated, matchbook-sized device in Sarah’s brain — a “pacemaker for the brain,” some call it — calibrated to detect the neural activity pattern that occurs when she is becoming depressed. It then delivers pulses of electrical stimulation to stave off depression. Sarah’s is the first documented case of personalizing a technique called deep brain stimulation to successfully treat depression.  Written by Astead W. Herndon and Ali Watkins | Narrated by Astead W. Herndon  Fire departments have rarely received the same level of public scrutiny with respect to racism as police departments, at least in part because firefighters lack the authority to use deadly force. In recent years, leaders at the New York Fire Department have embraced diversity initiatives and welcomed historically diverse classes into the academy. Daniel A. Nigro, the commissioner appointed by Mayor Bill de Blasio in 2014, said in an interview that the department was working to become more inclusive. He also admitted fault. After the murder of George Floyd more than a year ago touched off protests against racism and violence in policing, the culture inside New York City’s firehouses deteriorated, Mr. Charles and other Black firefighters said. White firefighters shared racist messages and memes on their phones mocking Mr. Floyd’s dying moments. They gloated about how police could “legally shoot Black children.”  In reporting this article, The New York Times reviewed the messages and internal communications and spoke to more than a dozen active and recently retired Black firefighters, as well as others familiar with the department’s inner workings.

28,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/10/08/world/nobel-peace-prize-2021,"Nobel Peace Prize Awarded to 2 Journalists, Highlighting Fight for Press Freedom - The New York Times","Oct. 8, 2021Updated 5:58 p.m. ET","In an era of increasing authoritarianism and swirling misinformation, Maria Ressa and Dmitri A. Muratov, who lead independent news outlets in the Philippines and Russia, were honored for their work to hold leaders to account. Awarding the Nobel to journalists recognizes the growing repression of media. Nobel laureate from Russia says he would have chosen a different Russian. Maria Ressa says of her work as a journalist: ‘Trust is what holds us together.’ Nobel announcement draws mixed reactions from Russia, with frustration from Navalny supporters. Maria Ressa is only the 18th woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Even as it praises the Russian prize winner, the Kremlin steps up its assault on independent news. Rappler has stood out in a landscape of growing media repression in Asia. Anti-Nobel sentiment has spawned alternative awards over the years. transcript The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2021 to Maria Ressa and Dmitri Muratov for their efforts to safeguard freedom of expression, which is a precondition for democracy and lasting peace. Ms. Ressa and Mr. Muratov are receiving the Peace Prize for their courageous fight for freedom of expression in the Philippines and in Russia. Seeking to bolster press freedoms as journalists find themselves under increasing pressure from authoritarian governments and other hostile forces, the Norwegian Nobel Committee on Friday awarded the Peace Prize to two journalists thousands of miles apart for their tireless efforts to hold the powerful to account. The journalists, Maria Ressa of the Philippines and Dmitri A. Muratov of Russia, were recognized for “their courageous fight for freedom of expression, which is a precondition for democracy and lasting peace.” “They are representatives of all journalists who stand up for this ideal in a world in which democracy and freedom of the press face increasingly adverse conditions,” the committee said in a statement released after the announcement in Oslo. Ms. Ressa — a Fulbright scholar, who was also named a Time magazine Person of the Year in 2018 for her crusading work against disinformation — has been a constant thorn in the side of Rodrigo Duterte, her country’s authoritarian president. The digital media company for investigative journalism that she co-founded, Rappler, has exposed government corruption and researched the financial holdings and potential conflicts of interest of top political figures. It has also done groundbreaking work on the Duterte government’s violent antidrug campaign. “The number of deaths is so high that the campaign resembles a war waged against the country’s own population,” the committee said. “Ms. Ressa and Rappler have also documented how social media is being used to spread fake news, harass opponents and manipulate public discourse.” She is only the 18th woman to win the Peace Prize in its 120-year history. Speaking on Rappler’s Facebook Live platform, Ms. Ressa said she hoped the award was a “recognition of how difficult it is to be a journalist today.” “This is for you, Rappler,” she said, her voice breaking slightly, adding that she hopes for “energy for all of us to continue the battle for facts.” Mr. Muratov has defended freedom of speech in Russia for decades, working under increasingly difficult conditions. Within hours of news of the award breaking, the Kremlin stepped up its crackdown on critics, labeling nine journalists and activists as “foreign agents,” a designation that imposes onerous requirements on them. One of the founders of the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta in 1993, Mr. Muratov has been its editor in chief since 1995. Despite a continual barrage of harassment, threats, violence and even murders, the newspaper has continued to publish. Since its start, six of the newspaper’s journalists have been killed, the committee noted, citing Anna Politkovskaya, who wrote revealing articles about the war in Chechnya. “Despite the killings and threats, editor in chief Muratov has refused to abandon the newspaper’s independent policy,” the committee wrote. “He has consistently defended the right of journalists to write anything they want about whatever they want, as long as they comply with the professional and ethical standards of journalism.” Many Russian dissidents had hoped and expected that the prize would go to Aleksei A. Navalny, the imprisoned opposition leader, expressing anger and disappointment that he was passed over. Mr. Muratov said the award had come as a surprise — and that he, too, would have given it to Mr. Navalny. He told Russian media that he had ignored several unidentified calls from Norway on Friday while arguing with one of his journalists; in the end, his press secretary gave him a heads-up seconds before the announcement. He said he would donate some of the prize money to the fight against spinal muscular atrophy, a cause for which he has long advocated, and to support journalism against pressure from the Russian authorities. “The fight against the media is not a fight against the media,” Mr. Muratov said in a radio interview on Friday. “It is a fight against the people.” This year was only the third time in the 120-year history of the prize that journalists were honored for contributions to the cause of peace. Ernesto Moneta, a newspaper editor and leader of the Italian peace movement, won in 1907. And Carl von Ossietzky, a German journalist, pacifist and opponent of Nazism, who was imprisoned by Hitler, won the 1935 prize. The Nobel committee chose from 329 candidates, one of the largest pools ever considered. Those who had been regarded as favorites included climate-change activists, political dissidents and scientists whose work helped fight the Covid-19 pandemic. In its citation, the committee said that “free, independent and fact-based journalism serves to protect against abuse of power, lies and war propaganda.” “Without freedom of expression and freedom of the press,” the committee said, “it will be difficult to successfully promote fraternity between nations, disarmament and a better world order to succeed in our time.” — Shashank Bengali and Marc Santora  The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to two journalists, Maria Ressa and Dmitri Muratov, comes at a time of growing assaults on a free press across the world, as authoritarian governments extend their reach and the slogan of “fake news” is used to suppress dissenting views. Ms. Ressa has faced multiple criminal charges for the way her news website Rappler has challenged the rule of President Rodrigo Duterte. Both she and Mr. Muratov, whose Novaya Gazeta newspaper has been a persistent critic of President Vladimir V. Putin, work under governments that use a range of methods — from repressive legislation to arrests — to muzzle criticism. Last year, both UNESCO and the Council of Europe issued reports deploring the erosion of media freedom. They noted growing police attacks on journalists covering protests, including intimidation and beatings, and the passing of so-called “fake news” laws in countries from Hungary to Russia that can be used to repress legitimate journalism. BREAKING NEWS: The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize to Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov for their efforts to safeguard freedom of expression, which is a precondition for democracy and lasting peace.#NobelPrize #NobelPeacePrize pic.twitter.com/KHeGG9YOTT The Committee to Protect Journalists reported that 274 journalists were imprisoned in 2020, the highest rate since 1992, and said “the number of journalists singled out for murder in reprisal for their work more than doubled in 2020.” The V-Dem Institute, a Swedish organization that tracks democratic indicators, said in their 2020 report that “media censorship and the repression of civil society” were “typically the first move in a gradual process” of moving toward autocracy and so “an early warning signal for what might yet be to come.” It reported that, with respect to freedom of the media, “32 countries are declining substantially, compared to only 19 just three years ago.” The Committee to Protect Journalists has noted that authoritarian governments have repeatedly taken cover in “anti-press rhetoric from the United States.” Leaders including Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and Hungarian President Viktor Orban have used former President Trump’s term “fake news” as a means to discredit the press in general. The existence online of a growing volume of disinformation becomes a means to undermine real and challenging journalism that adheres to the facts, especially for the growing number of governments across the world that brook no criticism. Both the Council of Europe and the Committee to Protect Journalists have expressed concern over the way the Covid-19 pandemic has led to violations of journalists’ freedom. “Despite the importance of media freedom, which arguably has never been more important than during this public health crisis, the pandemic has led to an array of restrictions on reporting,” Scott Griffen, the deputy director of the International Press Institute, said earlier this year. Among the repressive methods being used to intimidate the press are censorship, restrictive legislation, harassment and, as in Egypt’s case, sweeping curtailment of any social media accounts or websites that are deemed to constitute national security threats. Of her client, Ms. Ressa, Amal Clooney, a British international human rights lawyer, said: “I am grateful to the Nobel Committee for shining a light on her incredible courage.” She added that she hopes “this prize helps to protect the press around the world.” Announcing the award, the Nobel committee chair, Berit Reiss-Andersen, said: “Free, independent and fact-based journalism serves to protect against abuse of power, lies and war propaganda. Without freedom of expression and freedom of the press, it will be difficult to successfully promote fraternity between nations.” Among the prominent journalists murdered in recent years have been Daphne Caruana Galizia of Malta, the Slovakian investigative journalist Jan Kuciak, and, this year, Peter R. de Vries in the Netherlands. All had made it their business to reveal uncomfortable truths. — Roger Cohen  Dmitri A. Muratov, the Russian newspaper editor awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, said he would have given the honor to a different Russian: Aleksei A. Navalny. Mr. Navalny, the opposition leader jailed since January, had been seen as a favorite to win the prize. On Friday, some of Mr. Navalny’s supporters reacted with anger to the Nobel announcement, because they see Mr. Muratov as a figure open to compromise with the Kremlin rather than one who remains in principled opposition. “If I had been on the Nobel Peace Prize committee, I would have voted for the person whom the bookmakers bet on,” Mr. Muratov said in a news conference outside his newspaper’s Moscow headquarters. “I mean Aleksei Navalny.” In an earlier interview, Mr. Muratov cited Mr. Navalny’s courage. The prize announcement came amid a monthslong crackdown on the independent news media in Russia. Popular outlets and even individual journalists have been declared “foreign agents” by the government for allegedly receiving foreign financing, forcing them to include onerous disclaimers alongside all of their content, even on social media. Mr. Muratov noted that accepting the Nobel’s prize money could, in theory, open him up to being declared a foreign agent. It was an indication of how far the Kremlin’s campaign against the independent news media has gone that Mr. Muratov’s comment about that scenario did not come across as only a joke. “I posed this question today to the government officials who decided to congratulate me,” Mr. Muratov said. “Will we be declared foreign agents by receiving the Nobel Prize? I didn’t get a straight answer.” Mr. Muratov said his prize was posthumous recognition of the six journalists who had worked with Novaya Gazeta and been killed; he repeated all of their names twice. The most famous was Anna Politkovskaya, the investigative journalist who was murdered in Moscow on Oct. 7, 2006. As Mr. Muratov spoke, he urged the scrum of reporters listening to him to avoid trampling on the garden that the staff had planted in front of the newspaper’s offices in her memory. “They don’t give these Nobel Prizes posthumously,” he said. “I think they came up with this as a way for Anya to get the prize, through other, old hands.” — Anton Troianovski  transcript I am honored that the Norwegian Nobel Committee has honored me and my fellow journalist Dmitri Muratov in this way. This relentless campaign of harassment and intimidation against me and my fellow journalists in the Philippines is a stark example of a global trend that journalists and freedom of the press facing increasingly adverse conditions. The Philippine government filed 10 arrest warrants against me in the last year. The government has prevented my travel four times, including to — when my mother was diagnosed with cancer, and I needed to go to see my aging parents. I think this just shows you that the battle is worth it. The personal sacrifices are worth it. Maria Ressa said on Friday that her being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize was a recognition of the dangers of being a journalist at a time when freedom of the press was under attack. In an interview, Ms. Ressa said she was “breathless, stunned and happy” upon hearing about the honor, which she shared with the Russian journalist Dmitri A. Muratov. She said she was in the middle of a live panel discussion about a PBS documentary — which follows her struggles in the war that President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has waged on the press — when she got a call telling her that she had been awarded the prize. “I didn’t know how to react, and then, wow,” Ms. Ressa said. “The folks clapped and asked me for a reaction and it hit me. It’s so much that we’ve gone through in the last five and a half years and then this. These highs and lows are making me crazy.” Ms. Ressa, a co-founder of the independent news site Rappler, said that the Philippine government had filed 10 arrest warrants against her, with seven legal cases still pending. The authorities have essentially banned her from traveling, denying her last four requests to go overseas. “I’ve just seen my rights being taken away, very slowly,” she said. “What we’re seeing is a thousand cuts to the body politic, to our democracy.” In selecting two journalists for the Peace Prize, Ms. Ressa said, the Nobel committee showed the world “how dangerous it is to be a journalist today. We’ve never been under attack as much as we have been in the last few years.” WORLD EXCLUSIVE: The call from Oslo.Hear Maria Ressa’s reaction when she hears the news from Olav Njølstad, Secretary of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, on being awarded the 2021 #NobelPeacePrize just before the public announcement. ""I'm speechless!""#NobelPrize @mariaressa pic.twitter.com/Zxy20nzWvd Speaking earlier on her publication’s Facebook Live platform, Ms. Ressa referred to Mr. Duterte’s sweeping crackdown on drugs, which Rappler has covered extensively, uncovering evidence of extrajudicial killings. She called it a “moment that is so existential, the defense of our democracy in the Philippines, the defense of our rights, human rights, the fact that we have no idea exactly how many people have been killed in a brutal drug war.” In the drug campaign, she said, police had issued conflicting figures on the numbers of people killed — while rights groups have said that the true toll could reach 30,000. “This hall of mirrors has to change at a time when accountability does count,” she said. “And I think that what we have to do as journalists is to just hold the line.” “When you don’t have facts, you don’t have truth,” she added. “You don’t have trust. Trust is what holds us together to be able to solve the complex problems our world is facing today.” — Sui-Lee Wee  In the hours after Dmitri A. Muratov was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, reactions in Russia were mixed, exposing a deep divide among the Kremlin’s embattled critics on how to best push back against an increasingly authoritarian state. Many Russians rejoiced at Mr. Muratov’s award and celebrated the success of his newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, which has produced hard-hitting investigations despite tremendous pressure since it was founded almost three decades ago. But supporters of the jailed opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, who was poisoned last year in an operation that Western officials say was organized by the Russian security services, and subsequently jailed, were particularly disappointed. Mr. Muratov, himself, said on Friday that if it were up to him, Mr. Navalny would have won the prize, citing his courage. While Mr. Muratov has grown increasingly disillusioned with politics in Russia, he has sought to find ways to engage with the Kremlin. That was evident in the reaction of Mr. Putin’s chief spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, who congratulated him on the award. That more compromising approach has angered hard-line dissidents like Mr. Navalny, who from his prison cell rejects the prospect of cooperation with the authorities. Last month Mr. Navalny sought to organize a “smart voting” platform in Russia’s September parliamentary elections, but it was declared “extremist” by the Kremlin, which forced Google and Apple to remove apps related to the app store. “Instead of pretentious and hypocritical speeches about ‘freedom,’ they could protect a person who survived the assassination attempt and is now taken hostage by the murderers,” wrote Ruslan Shaveddinov, a project manager for Mr. Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation. Mr. Muratov is a member of the liberal Yabloko party, which did not support the “smart voting” initiative. That was in part because the app recommended that all opposition forces select one candidate most likely to beat Mr. Putin’s United Russia party. The recommended candidates included many from the Communist Party, an anathema to Mr. Muratov who believed it harkened back to the time of dictator Joseph Stalin. Mr. Muratov has also mounted a defense of Aleksei Venediktov, the editor in chief of the liberal radio station Ekho Moskvy, who oversaw the controversial online voting platform in the September elections. Many anti-government groups were concerned that the online voting system enabled what they alleged was election fraud that favored Mr. Putin’s party. Some observers argued that the choice of Novaya Gazeta, which is one of the last independent media outlets in Russia not to be named a “foreign agent,” sent the wrong message at the wrong time. “The decision to reward Muratov, not Navalny, is an attempt to keep the maximum distance from the current political process,” the political analyst and former Kremlin speechwriter Abbas Gallyamov wrote on Facebook. “We, they say, do not interfere in politics, we only support the principle of freedom of speech,” he added, referring to the Nobel committee. “This is probably correct.” Mr. Muratov said the prize, which is not awarded posthumously, was in honor of six colleagues on Novaya Gazeta who died doing their jobs. “This is the prize of my dead colleagues,” he said, “those who gave their lives for people who fought against dictatorship, who stood up for freedom of speech.” — Valerie Hopkins  In receiving the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, the Philippine journalist Maria Ressa became only the 18th woman to be selected for the award in its 120-year history. With half the world made up of women, the obvious question arises: Why have so few been granted the committee’s most prestigious prize and, more broadly, been generally underrepresented across the Nobel Prizes? Addressing the criticism, the Nobel committee in 2017 acknowledged its poor track record. “We are disappointed looking at the larger perspective that more women have not been awarded,” said Göran Hansson, vice chair of the board of directors of the Nobel Foundation. “Part of it is that we go back in time to identify discoveries,” he said. “We have to wait until they have been verified and validated before we can award the prize. There was an even larger bias against women then. There were far fewer women scientists if you go back 20 or 30 years.” But he acknowledged other problems, including the way people are considered for prizes. Starting in 2018, he said, the committee would take steps to address the imbalance. “I hope that in five years or 10 years, we will see a very different situation,” he said. A total of 109 individuals have received the Nobel Peace Prize, which has also been awarded to organizations. The first woman to receive the prize was Bertha von Suttner, an Austrian writer who was a leading figure in a nascent pacifist movement in Europe. She was recognized in 1905, two years after Marie Curie became the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, in physics. It would be 26 years before another woman was selected for the award: the American Jane Addams, regarded as the founder of modern social work and an advocate for the concerns of children and mothers. She shared the 1931 prize with Nicholas Murray Butler, then the head of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Other women to receive the honor include Mother Teresa in 1979; the legal reformer Shirin Ebadi of Iran in 2003; the Kenyan environmentalist Wangari Maathai in 2004; and in 2014 the education activist Malala Yousafzai, the youngest recipient of the award. In 2011, three women shared the award: Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the former president of Liberia; Leymah Gbowee, a peace activist from Liberia; and Tawakkol Karman, a journalist from Yemen who became the face of the “Arab Spring” uprising in her country. Here are the other women laureates, listed chronologically: 1946 — Emily Greene Balch, American economist, sociologist, pacifist and educator. 1976 — Betty Williams and Mearead Corrigan, founders of a Northern Ireland peace movement. 1982 — Alva Myrdal, Swedish diplomat and disarmament advocate. 1991 — Aung San Suu Kyi, pro-democracy activist in Myanmar. 1992 — Rigoberta Menchú Tum, leading advocate of Mayan rights and culture. 1997 — Jody Williams, American disarmament activist who campaigned to abolish land mines. 2018 — Nadia Murad, Yazidi activist from northern Iraq who escaped enslavement by the Islamic State and led campaign against sexual violence as a weapon of war. Rick Gladstone contributed reporting. An earlier version of this item incorrectly described the history of the Nobel Prize. It is 120 years old, not 126. — Shashank Bengali  Hours after a Russian newspaper editor received the Nobel Peace Prize for helping to “safeguard freedom of expression,” the Russian government made another move to muzzle that expression. Nine activists and journalists, including prominent Russian-language correspondents for the B.B.C. and the American-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, were declared “foreign agents” by Russia’s Justice Ministry. They now have to submit to onerous disclosure requirements, including having to attach a lengthy disclaimer to every social media post. It was the latest evidence that the Nobel for Dmitri A. Muratov came amid the most intense campaign of repression against the independent news media in Russia’s post-Soviet history. “The Parliament does not represent all the people, it does not represent the minority with an alternative point of view,” Mr. Muratov said outside his newspaper’s office in Moscow on Friday. “The media represents them, and this is exactly why, I believe, these attacks on the Russian press are taking place.” Leading Russian-language news outlets such as Meduza, TV Rain and Proekt have been declared “foreign agents” or banned outright in recent months, and investigative journalists have been driven into exile. Mr. Muratov’s Novaya Gazeta is the most prominent independent outlet remaining that has not been declared a foreign agent. Unlike some other independent journalists, Mr. Muratov has sought to find ways to engage with the Kremlin, and he took part in a meeting of Russian editors in chief with Mr. Putin earlier this year. But he has grown increasingly pessimistic about the future of political freedoms in Russia. Increasingly, he has said, it is the powerful Federal Security Service — the main successor agency to the K.G.B. — that is charged with managing domestic politics, limiting the space for activism or independent journalism ever more. In recent months, the Kremlin has been able to carry out its crackdown on dissent without provoking a widespread public backlash. That has emboldened the authorities, he says. “The authorities have suddenly realized that most people have absolutely no need for freedom,” Mr. Muratov told the Russian news website Znak.com in August. Some Russian analysts and journalists have speculated that it would be only a matter of time until Novaya Gazeta were outlawed or forced out of business. With its extensive coverage of sensitive matters like rights abuses in the Russian republic of Chechnya, environmental disasters caused by leading Russian companies and torture in prisons, the newspaper has earned many enemies. The recognition by the Nobel committee could give the newspaper a fresh lease on life, its supporters hope. On Friday, even Margarita Simonyan, the editor of the pro-Kremlin television channel RT, congratulated Mr. Muratov, noting he worked to help ill children. Mikhail V. Mishustin, the Russian prime minister, through his spokesman lauded Mr. Muratov for “his high professionalism, his loyalty to his convictions, and, importantly, his human qualities.” “We can congratulate Dmitri Muratov,” President Vladimir V. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters. “He consistently works according to his ideals. He is committed to his ideals, he is talented, he is brave and of course this is a high-level recognition.” The question now is whether the award for Mr. Muratov — the first Russian Nobel Peace Prize laureate in post-Soviet times — helps protect what remains of independent journalism in Russia. Some critics were quick to allege on Twitter that the award could serve the Kremlin by allowing Mr. Putin to point to Novaya Gazeta as proof that freedom of expression in Russia still exists. “We will try to help those people who are now being declared agents, who are being repressed, and who are being exiled from the country,” Mr. Muratov told a Russian news website, Podyom. — Anton Troianovski  In a year marked by climate change-driven disasters, political turmoil and the enduring devastation wrought by the coronavirus, the Norwegian Nobel Committee chose this year’s winners from a diverse array of 329 candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize. The candidates — whose names are not publicly revealed, but represented the third highest number of submissions in history — ranged from climate activists to political dissidents. Organizations including Reporters Without Borders and movements like Black Lives Matter were also in the running. The pool of candidates had been chosen from the thousands of nominations submitted to the committee by academics, scientists, former winners and politicians from around the world. Every year, speculation is rife over who will emerge from the intensely secretive voting process. Scientists whose work has helped combat climate change and improve the environment were recognized in Nobel Prizes handed out earlier this week. Two scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics on Wednesday for work that “laid the foundation of our knowledge of the Earth’s climate and how humanity influences it.” Two chemists were honored for findings that have helped lessen the impact of chemistry on the environment. Greta Thunberg, the 18-year-old climate activist from Sweden, was widely thought to be in the running for the peace award. She has been a top contender for the prize since 2019, when Time magazine recognized her as its “Person of the Year.” Among the hundreds of submissions, 95 were organizations. Last year, the $1 million cash prize went to the World Food Program, the United Nations agency that is the world’s largest humanitarian organization, for its efforts to combat a surge in global hunger amid the pandemic. With the world still struggling to emerge from a pandemic that has killed more than 4.6 million people, observers speculated that the Nobel committee might reward work being done to lessen the suffering. At the top of many shortlists was the U.N. World Health Organization, which has sought to act as the voice of authority amid a cacophony of misinformation surrounding the coronavirus. Scientists whose work over decades led to the rapid development of vaccines that have changed the course of the pandemic, to the surprise of many, were passed over when awards for Medicine and Chemistry were announced earlier in the week. But the global vaccine initiative, Covax, was a favorite of some odds makers who thought it might be selected for its ambitious, though struggling, efforts to promote equal access to the lifesaving vaccines. The committee did not wade into some of the most geopoliticaly charged waters by selecting a prominent political dissident. Among those believed to be in the running were Svetlana Tikhanovskaya of Belarus and Aleksei A. Navalny, whose strident opposition to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia galvanized some of the nation’s largest protests to his rule. But in choosing to award the work of two journalists who persist at great personal risk, they sought to elevate the struggle of reporters around the world working in increasingly repressive environments.  — Marc Santora and Cora Engelbrecht  Rappler’s newsroom buzzed with activity on Friday, the last day for candidates to file papers for an election in the Philippines next year, and young reporters were chatting about the day’s news over Slack. Then a reporter who was watching the Nobel Peace Prize announcement online told the team that Maria Ressa, one of their outlet’s founders, had won. “We are blown away,” said Pia Ranada, a political journalist who has been barred from official presidential events because of her aggressive coverage of President Rodrigo Duterte’s administration. Speaking in a phone interview, Ms. Ranada said, “I’m just full of gratitude for this recognition. We feel that Maria’s win is a win for our entire news organization and, in general, also for the Philippine press, especially those who’ve been trudging on and shining the light, despite the kind of governance we have now, where journalists are harassed for their work.” On its website, Rappler said it was “honored and astounded” by the award. “It could not have come at a better time — a time when journalists and the truth are being attacked and undermined,” the news organization said. “We thank the Nobel for recognizing all journalists both in the Philippines and in the world who continue to shine the light even in the darkest and toughest hours.” Rappler, a scrappy investigative and entertainment website that Ms. Ressa co-founded in 2012, has been a focus of Mr. Duterte’s campaign against the news media in the Philippines. In 2018, the news site’s license was revoked, and Ms. Ressa has been charged with defamation, tax evasion and the violation of complex security laws. In July 2018, a court sided with Rappler, saying the revocation of the license was wrong, allowing the site to continue to publish. Ms. Ressa created Rappler with three other high-powered women journalists — Lilibeth Frondoso, Glenda Gloria and Chay Hofileña — who cut their teeth as reporters during the “people power” revolt that brought down President Ferdinand E. Marcos in the mid-1980s. They have been arrested and faced death threats. A black funeral wreath was once delivered to the door of Ms. Gloria’s family home. Ms. Frondoso, Rappler’s head of multimedia, was once thrown in prison with her newborn child. “We have government officials who publicly denounce the journalism we do,” Ms. Ranada said, “so it’s really a huge moment for all of us here.” — Sui-Lee Wee  Across Asia, authoritarian governments and strongmen leaders are imprisoning reporters, imposing stifling legal requirements on news outlets and running independent websites out of business, exacerbating fears among journalists about the state of press freedom in the region.

ceit and “fake news,” even warning that they are “not exempted from assassination.” His government removed the country’s largest broadcast network, ABS-CBN,NA, from the air last year.  Yet Rappler’s dogged coverage of the Duterte administration has continued. In a statement, the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines said Ms. Ressa’s win was “a victory for press freedom advocates across the Philippines, which remains one of the most dangerous countries for journalists.” “We hope that Ressa’s win drives international attention to the plight of the Philippines’ local media workers, and sends a signal that a free, unstifled and critical press is necessary for a healthy democracy,” the group said. Across Asia, independent news outlets have faced growing pressures, sometimes being forced to close. This week, Singapore passed a contentious law barring foreign influence over politics, which gives the government the power to demand that social media platforms disclose user data or remove posts that are deemed to be antigovernment. Last month, the government suspended the license of The Online Citizen, an independent website offering social and political commentary, saying it had failed to comply with rules requiring it to declare its funding sources.  In Myanmar, the military government that seized power this year has arrested at least 98 journalists, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a watchdog. Five have been convicted of violating a law that makes it a crime to publish or circulate comments that “cause fear” or spread “false news,” according to Human Rights Watch.  Next Digital, a media company that was long the leading pro-democracy voice in Hong Kong, said last month that it would close after a crackdown by Beijing. That was the latest in a series of blows to Hong Kong’s once freewheeling press, which has been stifled by the national security law that the mainland Chinese government imposed on the former British colony more than a year ago. In India, watchdog groups say that press freedom has eroded under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose government has used legal threats and investigations to cow media outlets. This year, the government enacted rules granting it broad power to take down digital content, a move that many said was aimed at upstart independent news sites that offered some of the most critical coverage of Mr. Modi’s government. The Nobel Peace Prize “is a message to governments everywhere that genuine journalism cannot be suppressed,” said Sidharth Bhatia, a founding editor of The Wire, a news site in India that has faced numerous defamation lawsuits from members of Mr. Modi’s party. “It comes as a boost to journalists everywhere, especially to those in small, independent websites who face pressures from governments and continue to ask questions to power in the pursuit of truth.” — Sui-Lee Wee  During the tenure of President Vladimir V. Putin, six reporters for Novaya Gazeta, the newspaper that Dmitri A. Muratov co-founded in 1993, have been killed for their work. Most prominent was Anna Politkovskaya, an investigative journalist who was shot and killed on Oct. 7, 2006. Ms. Politkovskaya, a vocal critic of Mr. Putin and his policies in the Chechen war, was shot in the elevator to her apartment building in Moscow. While a court convicted several men for carrying out the assassination, the authorities left unanswered the question of who organized it. Mr. Putin, speaking soon after her death, denied any role by saying Ms. Politkovskaya’s death had created a bigger problem for Russia because of international criticism than her life and work as an investigative journalist. Founded in 1993, Novaya Gazeta has become the highest-profile independent newspaper in Russia for social and political affairs. The newspaper has three main owners: the last Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who used proceeds from his Nobel Peace Prize to finance the venture; Aleksandr Y. Lebedev, a former KGB agent turned banker and critic of the rise of a new police state; and the newspaper staff, which owns shares. In one of the early murders, the investigative reporter and member of Parliament Yuri Shchekochikhin died of a mysterious and painful illness that caused the epidermis, or upper layer of skin, to slough off, in a rare symptom caused by some drug allergies but which Novaya Gazeta newspaper concluded in its own investigation was poisoning. Mr. Shchekochikhin became ill days before he planned to travel to the United States to share information with American law enforcement about suspected corruption and money laundering at a furniture importing business, the Three Whales, linked to the Federal Security Service, the successor agency to the K.G.B., touching a nerve on an important trend of the security services moving into business. His autopsy results remain classified. In 2009, Russian nationalists shot to death another of the newspaper’s journalists, Anastasia Boburova, on a sidewalk in the capital together with a human rights lawyer. In another high-profile killing in 2009, the human rights activist Natalia Estemirova was kidnapped in the Chechen capital of Grozny and subsequently killed. Ms. Estemirova cooperated with Novaya Gazeta in cataloging killings, torture and abductions in Chechnya and linked them to the region’s leader, Ramzan A. Kadyrov. Ms. Estemirova continued this work even after the death of Ms. Politkovskaya in 2006, with whom she had begun her collaboration with the Novaya Gazeta newspaper. In recent years, the newspaper’s reporters have broken stories investigating the deaths of Russian soldiers in eastern Ukraine. Their leading reporter on the war, Pavel Kanygin, was kidnapped and beaten by separatists, but nonetheless returned for on-the-ground reporting for the newspaper’s investigation into the shoot-down of a civilian airliner over Ukraine in 2014. — Andrew E. Kramer  Since it went live in January 2012, Rappler, the website co-founded by Maria Ressa and three other female journalists, has become one of the Philippines’ most popular and influential media platforms, mixing reporting with calls for social activism. Rappler’s reporters, most of whom are in their 20s, have been especially critical of President Rodrigo Duterte, investigating his extrajudicial killing campaign against people suspected of dealing or using drugs, documenting the spread of government disinformation on Facebook and reporting on malfeasance among his top advisers. As a result, the site has incurred Duterte’s wrath and been targeted by his loyalists; Ms. Ressa has been forced to increase her personal security and been in and out of court to answer a litany of charges — from libel to tax evasion — that she describes as politically motivated. In 2020, after years of government threats and accusations, Ms. Ressa and a former Rappler colleague were convicted of cyber libel by a court in Manila. Each could face up to six years in prison, and each was fined $8,000; Ms. Ressa has appealed the ruling. At the time, she said her conviction should serve as a warning. “We’re redefining what the new world is going to look like, what journalism is going to become,” she said. “Are we going to lose freedom of the press?” While former President Donald J. Trump called American reporters “the enemy of the people,” Mr. Duterte goes a step further, calling them “sons of bitches” who are “not exempt from assassination.” He has publicly targeted Rappler, calling it a “fake news outlet” sponsored by the C.I.A. Ms. Ressa,58, is a dual citizen of the Philippines and the United States, where she spent part of her childhood in Toms River, N.J. She attended Princeton and returned to the Philippines in 1986 on a Fulbright fellowship, as the country was transitioning away from authoritarianism and adopting liberal, democratic ideas. CNN was looking for a fluent English speaker to report on the transformation and hired Ms. Ressa. She became a fixture of the network’s Asia coverage. After a stint at the ABS-CBN network, she left to start Rappler. In 2016, Rappler began dispatching reporters into the barrios to investigate the drug killings. Ms. Ressa’s reporters found that the police versions of the murders often didn’t match witness accounts. “Some of the victims seemed to be innocent men whom the police had set up, planting drugs and guns to make it look like these were suspects who resisted,” said Rambo Talabong, a Rappler intern at the time who covered the drug war. Rappler disputed the death count of 2,167 announced by the Duterte administration at the end of 2016, reporting that about 4,000 more shootings that the government had listed as “unexplained homicides” were in fact part of Mr. Duterte’s drug war. Later, Rappler reporters uncovered evidence that Mr. Duterte’s loyalists had manipulated Facebook to spread misinformation, prompting Facebook to take down hundreds of pages, accounts and groups for “coordinated inauthentic behavior,” all of them linked to a group started by Nic Gabunada, Duterte’s social media strategist at the time. — Joshua Hammer and Jason Gutierrez  For more than a century, the annual announcement of the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize has generated global fascination, making the award a byword for selflessness and integrity. Some of the Norwegian Nobel Committee’s selections, however, have also created controversies that have cast a shadow over the award. In 2019, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed of Ethiopia was honored for his “efforts to achieve peace and international cooperation,” especially his initiative to resolve a long-running border conflict with Eritrea. In his Nobel laureate’s lecture, Mr. Abiy spoke of the need to “plant seeds of love, forgiveness and reconciliation in the hearts and minds of our citizens.” Two years later, Mr. Abiy has faced condemnation from human rights groups for unleashing a brutal military offensive in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region. Pro-government forces have been accused of massacres, sexual assault and ethnic cleansing, and United Nations officials have said the fighting has worsened a famine in which hundreds of thousands are going hungry. Even at the time of his award, some experts questioned the wisdom of granting the prize to a young leader who had only been in office for a year, and whose commitment to peace had not been tested. Asked by Al Jazeera in late 2019 whether Mr. Abiy deserved the award, the Nobel committee declined to address concerns about human rights, saying in a statement: “The Norwegian Nobel Committee hopes the peace agreement will help to bring about positive change for the entire populations of Ethiopia and Eritrea.” To some, the questions recalled those raised about another young, unproven leader: President Barack Obama, who was awarded the prize in 2009 after less than a year in office. The committee honored Mr. Obama for “extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.” Three years later, after Mr. Obama had led the overthrow of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, surged U.S. troops into Afghanistan and escalated U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen, the author and security analyst Peter Bergen described him as “one of the most militarily aggressive American leaders in decades.” Other selections have also generated criticism. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was awarded the prize in 1973 for his efforts to negotiate an end to the war in Vietnam, despite his alleged involvement in the devastating U.S. bombing campaign in Cambodia. Aung San Suu Kyi was given the award in 1991 for her opposition to military rule in Myanmar; two decades later, she is better known as the elected leader who defended the army’s brutal offensive against Rohingya Muslims, and who was ousted in a coup earlier this year. The controversies have dogged the committee, which according to Nobel rules cannot withdraw a prize once it is given. Some commentators have called for the committee, which is made up of five members appointed by Norway’s Parliament, and often include retired politicians, to resign and for international experts to take their place. “The Nobel name carries international weight and a committee with world-class capabilities should protect it,” Kjetil Tronvoll, director of Peace and Conflict studies at Bjorknes University College in Norway, wrote this year in the Guardian. — Shashank Bengali  The choice of a Nobel Peace Prize recipient has often been viewed by autocratic governments as a provocative and hostile act, especially when the winner is a political opponent, an advocate of free expression or an agitator for greater liberties. Some authoritarian countries have even created their own anti-Nobel awards. The best-known recent example is the 2010 establishment of the Confucius Peace Prize in China, named after the venerated Chinese sage of the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. The prize was part of the angry official reaction to the Nobel Peace Prize that year, which was awarded to Liu Xiaobo, a prominent dissident and author imprisoned by the Chinese Communist authorities for subversion. The first Confucius Prize ceremony was timed to coincide with the Nobel ceremony in Oslo, Norway, which Mr. Liu, who was imprisoned, and his wife, who was under house arrest, had been banned from attending. Even though Confucius Prize officials said their award’s creation had nothing to do with the Nobel, a booklet distributed at their ceremony stated: “China is a symbol of peace” and “Norway is only a small country with scarce land area and population.” The Confucius award appeared to have been organized so hastily that the winner, a Taiwanese politician who advocated greater ties with the Chinese mainland, was not even aware that he had won. Another well-known instance of anti-Nobel vindictiveness came after Carl von Ossietzky, a German journalist and pacifist who opposed the Nazis, was awarded the 1935 Nobel Prize, in what was widely viewed as a world repudiation of Adolf Hitler and everything he stood for. Hitler not only banned Mr. Von Ossietzky from accepting the prize, he prohibited any Germans from accepting any Nobel award in any category. Instead he established the German National Prize for Art and Science, an annual award given to three German citizens. The award was disbanded when World War II began in 1939. Awards traced to criticism of the Nobels also have derived from the opposite political direction — activists who say they need to be broadened to better reflect a wider spectrum of achievements in the fields of justice, education and social change. A well-known example is the Right Livelihood Award, sometimes called the “Alternative Nobel,” established in 1980 by Jakob von Uexküll, a Baltic-German writer and philanthropist. According to the Right Livelihood Award’s website, Mr. Von Uexküll had first proposed two additional Nobel Prizes to the Nobel Foundation, one for environmental work and the other for promotion of knowledge. When the foundation rejected the proposal, he founded an award himself, selling his stamp collection to initially finance the prize money. Right Livelihood laureates span a wide array of social activists and others from more than 50 countries. This year’s winners, announced Sept. 29, were from Cameroon, Russia," Canada and India. — Rick Gladstone""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Wali Arian KABUL, Afghanistan — An Islamic State suicide bomber devastated a Shiite mosque in the northern Afghan city of Kunduz on Friday, killing dozens of worshipers in a deadly continuation of the terrorist group’s campaign against the Hazara minority. The massacre, while the mosque was crowded for Friday Prayer, was the group’s second attack against a mosque in just a few days. And it was the realization of Afghan Hazaras’ fears that the Islamic State’s predation would go unchecked under the rule of the Taliban, which itself preyed on the Hazara in the past. Witness accounts described a powerful explosion with many casualties. Matullah Rohani, a Taliban official in Kunduz, told local media that at least 43 people were killed by the attack and more than 140 were injured. A local Shiite community leader put the death toll much higher. Sayed Ahmad Shah Hashemi, who represents Kunduz Province’s Shiite population, told The New York Times that more than 70 people were killed in the attack. “This deadly incident has caused trauma among Shiites and other sectors of the society,” Mr. Hashemi said. Hours after the bombing, it was claimed by the Islamic State Khorasan, also known as ISIS-K. It was the group’s deadliest strike since the suicide bombing at the international airport in Kabul on Aug. 26 that killed about 170 civilians and 13 U.S. troops. ISIS-K is a Sunni extremist group that has long targeted Shiite Muslims in Afghanistan, focusing heavily on the Hazara ethnic minority, which is predominantly Shiite. Most of Afghanistan is Sunni, and ethnic Pashtuns — who make up most of the Taliban’s ranks — are a plurality in the country.  ISIS-K also staged an attack several days ago outside a mosque in Kabul, the capital, which killed several people. In the months before American forces withdrew from Afghanistan, some 8,000 to 10,000 jihadist fighters from Central Asia, the North Caucasus region of Russia, Pakistan and the Xinjiang region in western China poured into Afghanistan, a United Nations report said in June. Most were said to be associated with the Taliban or Al Qaeda, which are closely linked, but others were allied with the Islamic State. In claiming the attack in Kunduz on Friday, the ISIS-K statement said that the attacker was ethnic Uyghur — an oppressed Muslim minority in western China. China has long been concerned that Afghanistan could become a haven for Uyghur militants who might seek to attack Chinese government interests in revenge for its abuses against the Muslim population in Xinjiang. The newly installed Taliban government, having overthrown the country’s Western-backed administration in August, is struggling to contain an invigorated Islamic State. The group has grown increasingly antagonistic in recent weeks, conducting guerrilla-style attacks and bombings that have included Taliban fighters among the dead. The new government is also struggling with a collapsing economy as foreign funding remains largely frozen. As Taliban officials shift from leading an insurgency to forming a functioning state, providing security to a population ravaged by more than 40 years of war has been their benchmark. But Islamic State attacks have undercut the Taliban’s promises. The Taliban’s chief spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, condemned the attack on Friday, and vowed retribution. For Afghanistan’s Shiite minority, the new Taliban era has seen a continuation of the predation and violence that has stalked them for decades. The Hazara grew increasingly bitter toward the U.S.-backed government of President Ashraf Ghani in recent years, accusing it of doing little to protect them against sectarian massacre. And they looked at the Taliban’s return to power with dread: During the 1990s civil war era and first Taliban government in Afghanistan, the group made a point of targeting Hazara Shiites.

By Ken Belson Jon Gruden, the coach of the Las Vegas Raiders, in 2011 used racist terms to denounce DeMaurice Smith, the executive director of the N.F.L. Players Association, who is Black and is now facing opposition within the union to the extension of his contract. The email surfaced just hours before the player representatives for the 32 teams voted to give Smith a fifth term as the union’s leader, this time without having to hold a general election. Smith was not endorsed by the union’s selection committee earlier this week, a sign that he was facing unusually stiff opposition within his own ranks. Some players have accused Smith of being too conciliatory to the league. There is reason to believe the league’s owners prefer that he stay, and such an inflammatory email, first reported by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed by The New York Times, complicated the vote for players who opposed Smith. While Smith has been combative with the N.F.L. at times, he is viewed favorably by many owners who worked closely with him last season to get the players back on the field during the pandemic. The email was written in 2011 in an exchange between Gruden, who is white and was an analyst for ESPN at the time, and Bruce Allen, who was then the president of the Washington Football Team. “Dumboriss Smith has lips the size of michellin tires,” Gruden wrote about Smith in the exchange. The email was discovered during a review of workplace misconduct at the Washington Football Team that ended this summer. During the past few months, the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, told league executives to look at more than 650,000 emails, including the one that included Gruden’s comment. This week, the executives presented a summary of that review to Goodell and shared with him the Raiders emails pertaining to Gruden. “The email from Jon Gruden denigrating DeMaurice Smith is appalling, abhorrent and wholly contrary to the N.F.L.’s values,” Brian McCarthy, a league spokesman, said in a statement.  The league declined to say whether Gruden could face disciplinary action. Smith said in a statement that Gruden's comments are symptomatic of the challenges that Black Americans face. “You know people are sometimes saying things behind your back that are racist just like you see people talk and write about you using thinly coded and racist language,” said Smith, who took over as the union’s executive director in 2009. “Racism like this comes from the fact that I’m at the same table as they are and they don’t think someone who looks like me belongs.” Mark Davis, the Raiders’ owner, called Gruden’s email “disturbing and not what the Raiders stand for.” He added that the team first learned about the email on Thursday and is reviewing “it along with other materials provided to us today by the N.F.L.” “We are addressing the matter with Coach Gruden and will have no further comment at this time,” Davis said. Gruden said that he did not recall the email, but acknowledged that in 2011, he was angered by the stalled labor talks between the league and union which led the owners to lockout the players. “I probably looked at De as the villain,” he told The Athletic on Friday. “And I was really upset that there was going to be a lockout.” He added that “I went too far calling him the Michelin lips. I never had a blade of racism in me” and that he “used a terrible way to insult a guy.” Gruden said he called Smith but had not heard back. Gruden was working in 2011 as an analyst for “Monday Night Football,” three years after leaving a head coaching job at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In 2018, he signed a 10-year contract to coach the Raiders, when the team was still playing in Oakland, Calif. Smith has been facing the biggest challenge to his leadership in his 12 years running the union. On Tuesday, the union’s selection committee deadlocked, 7-7, on whether to give Smith a new contract and a fifth term. Four years ago, that same committee voted unanimously to extend Smith’s tenure. Smith just barely won the two-thirds approval of the 32 team representatives he needed to avoid an open election, which could have led to more turmoil at the union and undermined what has generally been a cooperative relationship with Goodell. In the vote, 22 players voted to extend Smith’s contract, eight opposed it and two abstained. In a sign of ambivalence about his leadership, Smith may only get a short term contract, not a four-year agreement. After the vote, J.C. Tretter, a center on the Cleveland Browns and the union’s president, said in a statement that Smith “was transparent with us about his interest in moving on after this term and for the stability and security of our union, he will work with our player leadership to ensure we have a succession plan in place for the next leader.” Tretter did not say when Smith made the decision to leave after his term expires, or how long his term would last. The opposition to Smith stems from lingering resentment over the 10-year labor agreement that the players ratified in March 2020, just as the coronavirus pandemic gripped the country. Richard Sherman, now on the Buccaneers, and other veteran players were disgusted that Smith, who initially opposed the owners’ insistence on the addition of a 17th game this season, ended up supporting it. The union’s own executive committee — normally a source of support for Smith — voted against the deal. But the union pressed ahead anyway, and the agreement was ratified by just 60 votes, receiving 51.5 percent of the vote among a group with more than 2,000 members. Some players were unhappy that the union only clawed back an additional percentage point of the league’s revenue from the owners in return for a 17th game. Others noted that there is no mechanism to reopen the deal before it expires in 2031, which some players see as an owner-friendly concession. The union also agreed to cut benefits to roughly 400 former players on permanent disability, a decision that Smith later had to justify. Additionally, some players were upset that the union’s leadership rubber-stamped Smith’s last extension and wanted to at least hold an open election to consider other candidates. “For the players, this may signify a long period of dissatisfaction with a C.B.A. that wasn’t all they hoped for,” said Robert Boland, who teaches a course on collective bargaining in professional sports at Penn State University. “This has turned into a referendum on Smith’s 12-year tenure.” Boland represented Russell Okung, a member of the executive committee who last March accused Smith and the union’s staff of acting in bad faith by forcing a vote on the labor deal over the objections of the committee, in violation of the union’s constitution. Okung also accused the union’s leadership of trying to muzzle him from speaking out about the lack of transparency about the committee’s negotiations with N.F.L. owners, which began in 2019. Okung asked the National Labor Relations Board to intervene, but the independent federal agency guarding employee rights turned him down. His filing, though, turned out to be a harbinger of the discontent that carried into 2021, well before Gruden’s email surfaced.

31,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/nyregion/gifted-talented-nyc-schools.html,De Blasio to Phase Out N.Y.C. Gifted and Talented Program - The New York Times,"Oct. 8, 2021Updated 4:59 p.m. ET","Advertisement Supported by The mayor unveiled a plan to replace the highly selective program, which has become a glaring symbol of segregation in New York City public schools, for incoming students. It will be up to his successor to implement it. By Eliza Shapiro Mayor Bill de Blasio on Friday unveiled a plan to overhaul gifted and talented education in New York City elementary schools, calling for sweeping changes to a highly selective program that has been widely criticized for exacerbating segregation in the nation’s largest school system. Under Mr. de Blasio’s plan — released when he has just three months left in office — elementary school students who are currently enrolled in gifted classes would become the final cohort in the existing program. The system would be replaced by a program that offers the possibility of accelerated learning to students in the later years of elementary school. And the test given to kindergarten students to screen for the gifted program, already suspended in part because the city’s advisory school board refused to renew it last year, would be permanently ended. “I bet you a lot of parents are going to look at this plan and say this is a reason to stay” in public schools, Mr. de Blasio said in a radio interview on Friday, adding that far more children would have the opportunity to receive some accelerated learning than under the existing system. But some families and elected officials who support keeping aspects of the current gifted system sharply disagreed. Mr. de Blasio has been criticized for not taking forceful action to fulfill his promise of tackling inequality in public schools. The announcement comes just three months before he must leave office because of term limits, putting the fate of the plan in the hands of his successor. Mr. de Blasio, who is weighing a run for governor next year, has also said the plan could change as the city seeks comment from the public. Eric Adams, the Democratic nominee for mayor and the prohibitive favorite to win next month’s election, has rejected calls to get rid of gifted classes, and has instead said he favors an expansion of the programs into low-income neighborhoods. Experts have said that plan would do little to integrate the programs without more direct changes to admissions. “Eric will assess the plan and reserves his right to implement policies based on the needs of students and parents, should he become mayor,” said Evan Thies, a spokesman for Mr. Adams’s campaign. “Clearly the Department of Education must improve outcomes for children from lower-income areas.” The mayor’s action attempts to address what the city has known for decades: Its gifted and talented program has contributed to racially segregated classrooms and schools for thousands of students citywide. Though about 70 percent of the roughly 1 million public school students in New York are Black and Latino, about 75 percent of the roughly 16,000 students in gifted elementary school classes are white or Asian American. For years, rising kindergarten students have gained access to the program via a high-stakes exam that some families pay tutors to help their children prepare for. The programs are considered a crucial stepping stone for students seeking to advance into competitive middle and high schools. Many parents, including Black and Latino parents, have sought out gifted classes as an alternative to the city’s struggling district schools, and have come to rely on them as a way to set their children up for future success. But many other parents and experts say the system has worsened segregation and weakened instruction for children who are not in the gifted track. Not surprisingly, reaction to Mr. de Blasio’s plan was mixed. Robin Kelleher, an elected parent leader in District 2, said Friday that Mr. de Blasio’s announcement felt like a “political stunt,” and that the mayor would be leaving a pile of “bloody broken bone fragments” for Mr. Adams to clean up. But Karla Stenius, a parent in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, said she believed that gifted programs made it more difficult for children in regular classes to thrive. “If we’re just dumping a bunch of resources into gifted and talented,” she said, “everybody else suffers because they didn’t know somebody or they couldn’t afford a tutor.” Mr. de Blasio’s schools chancellor, Meisha Porter, who was appointed this year and has a good relationship with the mayor, has been instrumental in pushing him to fundamentally alter the gifted and talented program, according to people with knowledge of the last several months of intensive negotiations on the issue. Mr. Adams has endorsed a very different approach to gifted and talented: keep the classes, but increase them in low-income neighborhoods. Though that idea has been questioned by researchers, who have said it would do little to integrate the programs, it is popular with some parents, including Black and Latino families who want more gifted options. Reversing Mr. de Blasio’s plan could be difficult, since it would require Mr. Adams to either resume the use of the unpopular admissions exam or come up with a new admissions method within the first few months of his mayoralty to allow students enough time to apply. Mr. Adams has said in the past that he supported keeping the exam, which was broadly criticized by experts, but that it should not be the only way that young children are evaluated for academic skills.  Under Mr. de Blasio’s plan, New York City will no longer admit rising kindergarten students into separate gifted classes or schools starting next fall. Instead, the city will train all its kindergarten teachers — roughly 4,000 educators — to accommodate students who need accelerated learning within their general education classrooms. The city does not yet have an estimate for how much the training will cost, though it is expected to be tens of millions of dollars. And instead of the admissions exam, the city will evaluate all rising third graders, using past work and input from their teachers, to determine whether they need higher-level instruction in specific subject areas, for one or two periods a day. The mayor has not yet solicited feedback from parent groups or elected officials on his gifted and talented plan. Officials said that he planned to consult with families and educators on the plan throughout October and November, and that aspects of the proposal could shift before he leaves office. It is not yet clear, for example, what will happen to the five schools across the city that exclusively serve children who are considered gifted. A well-organized group of parents who back keeping gifted classes in some form, with support from elected officials like State Senator John C. Liu, a Democrat from Queens, have criticized the mayor in recent months for preparing a new system without getting input from parents. Many of those families have children who attend school in Manhattan’s District 2, one of the city’s whitest and wealthiest school districts. The mayor’s earlier push to eliminate the admissions exam for the city’s most elite high schools, including Stuyvesant High School, failed after he announced the plan without first seeking feedback from the many thousands of Asian American parents whose children would be most affected. Those families spent months forcefully pushing back against the plan, and their opposition ultimately helped defeat it in the State Legislature. The mayor’s other significant action on integration, a plan announced late last year to remove some admissions requirements at competitive middle and high schools, was rolled out without significant public comment. While changes to admissions to the city’s specialized high schools are subject to legislative approval, Mr. de Blasio has full power over all other schools, including gifted programs. The mayor’s plan for the future of gifted education is similar to a proposal made in 2019 by a task force he convened on school integration measures — a plan that he had, until now, mostly ignored. Many of the people who were involved in that proposal celebrated Mr. de Blasio’s announcement on Friday, even though they said it came far too late in his tenure. Jumaane Williams, the public advocate who is also weighing a bid for governor, said the plan was “a long time coming.” “We can’t just rest and rely on the way things have been, we need to have the courage and drive to move forward,” Mr. Williams, who himself attended a gifted program in New York, said in a statement. The mayor has faced eight years of private pressure on the issue from his three schools chancellors, all of whom have been skeptical of, if not completely opposed to, separate gifted classes. The mayor’s first chancellor, Carmen Fariña, got rid of gifted classes in the Manhattan elementary school she ran for many years as a principal. The second chancellor, Richard A. Carranza, resigned earlier this year, in part because he was frustrated by what he considered the mayor’s reluctance to take bold action on gifted and talented education. While Mr. de Blasio’s announcement represents a major shift for New York, it is hardly pioneering. Only about 10 percent of districts nationwide have entirely separate gifted classrooms and schools, according to Halley Potter, a fellow at the Century Foundation, a think tank. Some experts believe that labeling students as gifted and plucking them out of general education classrooms altogether exacerbates segregation by removing resources from regular public schools, and siphoning the strongest students and teachers elsewhere. Researchers have argued that those children can still receive additional attention within normal classrooms. But that requires many thousands of city educators to pull off some of the hardest work in public education: teaching children with a large range of abilities in one classroom, a practice known as differentiation. “Differentiation is like a fuzzy blue unicorn, said Jonathan Plucker, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Education and a proponent of gifted education whom the city consulted on its plan. “It would be great if everyone had one, I’m just not sure it’s possible.” Precious Fondren contributed reporting.

32,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/technology/apple-epic-games-lawsuit.html,Apple Appeals App Store Ruling in Fight With Epic Games - The New York Times,"Oct. 8, 2021Updated 7:18 p.m. ET","Advertisement Supported by At the heart of the legal battle is the power Apple wields over its lucrative App Store. By Kellen Browning Apple asked a federal appeals court on Friday to throw out a legal decision that would require the tech giant to tweak its strict App Store rules and force it to allow app developers to inform customers of ways to pay for subscriptions and services outside the App Store. The September verdict followed a yearlong legal battle between Apple and Epic Games, the maker of the game Fortnite. Apple also asked a judge to delay the ruling mandating App Store changes until after the appeal is heard. Changing its rules too quickly, Apple argued, “would upset the careful balance between developers and customers provided by the App Store, and would irreparably harm both Apple and consumers.” Epic declined to comment on Apple’s action on Friday. At the heart of the fight between the companies is the power Apple wields over its lucrative App Store. The App Store generates $20 billion a year, by some estimates, and its business model requires developers that distribute their apps on iPhones to pay Apple up to 30 percent of their sales. Calling the fees and other App Store rules unfair, Epic accused Apple of anticompetitive behavior and took the tech giant to court in May, but the judge, Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, ruled that Apple did not have a monopoly in the mobile games market. Still, Judge Gonzalez Rogers said Apple had violated California’s laws against unfair competition by prohibiting app developers from steering their customers to payment services outside the App Store. Under longtime App Store rules, companies were not allowed to tell people who used their apps that they could visit those companies’ websites or other locations to pay for services. The judge gave Apple 90 days to change its rules and allow developers to start advertising alternative payment methods. On Friday, Apple asked the judge to consider its request, called a stay of injunction, on Nov. 2, in hopes that it will be granted a delay until the appeals process with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, is finished. The company said that could take at least a year. Epic, also unhappy with aspects of the judge’s decision, appealed the verdict shortly after it was delivered. Still at issue is the question of what exactly Apple would be forced to change if the injunction was upheld. Some have speculated that developers could go as far as offering their own competing payment methods within the App Store, but Apple said Friday that it “disagrees with this broad interpretation” of the judge’s ruling. The company said it had already done some of what Judge Gonzalez Rogers wanted by agreeing as part of a settlement in August to allow developers to use email and other methods to communicate with their customers about alternative payment methods. The legal battle began in August last year when Epic tried to direct Fortnite players around Apple’s payment methods, prompting Apple to boot Fortnite from the App Store. Epic sued, and the two companies met in May in a courthouse in Oakland, Calif. Apple recently rejected Epic’s request to reinstate its developer account and return Fortnite to the App Store. The dispute was followed with keen interest by the tech industry, as Apple is facing accusations of anticompetitive practices and calls for regulation around the world, from Japan and South Korea to the European Union and Congress.

By David E. Sanger, Katie Rogers and Julian E. Barnes President Biden signed into law on Friday a new government program to compensate C.I.A. officers, State Department diplomats and other federal officials who have suffered traumatic neurological injuries that the intelligence community has yet to figure out, launched by assailants it cannot yet identify. With no ceremony and little public comment, Mr. Biden signed the Havana Act, authorizing Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and the C.I.A. director, William J. Burns, to give financial support to employees who have suffered brain injuries. The act is named for what has become known as “Havana Syndrome,” a series of unexplained injuries whose victims were first identified five years ago at the United States Embassy in Cuba. But Mr. Biden’s silence about the new law — he issued a statement, but avoided a public ceremony where he might be asked questions — was telling. While some officials are convinced the syndrome is the result of attacks and that one or more rival powers are responsible, intelligence agencies have yet to come to any firm conclusions, despite the appointment of multiple task forces to identify the cause and possible countermeasures. There is a widespread belief, supported by a study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, that the cause is directed energy, possibly microwaves, presumably targeted at embassies and residences. But even that is just the leading theory, and though Russia is the lead suspect, it is hardly the only country with the technology to conduct such attacks. The C.I.A. and the National Security Council have created an outside panel with access to classified information to help search for a cause. “We are bringing to bear the full resources of the U.S. government to make available first-class medical care to those affected and to get to the bottom of these incidents, including to determine the cause and who is responsible,” Mr. Biden said of the law. “Civil servants, intelligence officers, diplomats, and military personnel all around the world have been affected by anomalous health incidents,” Biden said, stopping short of using the word “attacks.” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, did not go into specifics on Friday when asked whether the episodes posed a threat to the American public, or specifically to Americans traveling abroad. “We take every reported incident seriously and what we want to do is ensure that our national security team is using every resource at our disposal,” Ms. Psaki said. “Without an attribution and an assessment of the cause for the origin, I do not want to go further.” The president’s signature came just as the episodes appear to be increasing in frequency and some have become more brazen: A C.I.A. officer traveling with Mr. Burns to India several weeks ago became the latest victim, in an incident that resonated inside the White House because his travels had not been publicized, and because targeting a member of the traveling party of the C.I.A. director — if that is what happened — seemed especially provocative. The India incident came after two dozen or more cases were reported in Vienna, which is home to three U.S. Embassies (two of which are linked to United Nations agencies), as well as the negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program. It is also the operating territory of spies from around the world. And over the summer, Vice President Kamala Harris’s trip to Vietnam was delayed for several hours because of concerns over incidents there. The incidents have led to a rare example of bipartisan agreement in fiercely partisan Washington. The original bill was written by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, guided the bill through the House, where it passed unanimously. Ms. Collins said she was increasingly convinced that some adversary was behind the incidents. “As we continue our efforts to support victims, we must also redouble our whole-of-government approach to identify and stop the heartless adversary who is harming U.S. personnel,” she said in a statement on Friday. Mark S. Zaid, a lawyer who represents multiple victims, said the legislation was “a good and necessary first step but it’s woefully deficient in many ways.” The bill leaves it up to the leaders of the C.I.A. and State Department to make their own determinations as to who is covered and how much compensation they receive, meaning “it has the opportunity to create incredible inconsistencies between agencies as to how they’re dealing with it,” Mr. Zaid said. “This is the type of case that demands uniform standards throughout the federal government. Someone at State should not be treated differently than someone at C.I.A.” An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity to disclose internal communications, said that officials standardized what they conceded had been an ad hoc and uneven reporting process across agencies before Mr. Biden took office, and that the State Department released guidance over the summer that assured employees they would receive the same standard of care as people from other agencies, including the C.I.A. Victims’ groups that have been pushing for their injuries to be recognized and compensated applauded the signing. Robyn Garfield, a Commerce Department official who was injured in China, said the critical next step was to make sure victims who could no longer work were receiving proper care. Mr. Garfield also said uniform diagnostic and treatment plans had to be adopted. “For too long, too many of us have been treated as adversaries and not partners by our own agencies,” Mr. Garfield said.  Mark Lenzi, a State Department official who was also injured in China, said it was time for Congress to hold hearings, adding that there was more information collected by the government that lawmakers must review. “This Havana Act legislation is crucial but only a first step towards getting injured U.S. government personnel and their family members the help we should have received years ago,” Mr. Lenzi said.

34,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/world/americas/mexico-blinken-migration-security.html,"At Mexico-U.S. Security Talks, Migration Question Is Largely Avoided - The New York Times","Oct. 8, 2021Updated 9:29 p.m. ET","Advertisement Supported by As diplomats from both countries began negotiating a new security agreement on Friday, the focus was on stopping criminal activity while the border crisis was conspicuously sidestepped. By Lara Jakes and Maria Abi-Habib MEXICO CITY — The United States and Mexico began overhauling an aged security agreement on Friday to better confront the flow of criminal activity between the two nations, but officials at the high-level talks conspicuously sought to avoid focusing on the ever-growing migrant crisis on their shared border. It was a striking omission, given the thousands of people, largely from Central America and the Caribbean, crowded on the Mexican side of the border, many in squalid camps, seeking entry to the United States. And it underscored the inertia in both governments for finding a broad solution for managing the crisis, particularly after the U.S. Supreme Court in August rejected President Biden’s efforts to let some migrants in by easing asylum restrictions imposed by the Trump administration. Instead, the top diplomats and immigration, defense, economic and legal officials from Mexico and the United States began discussing on Friday a replacement to the Mérida Initiative, a security agreement signed in 2008. That compact saw millions of dollars in weapons flow from the United States government to its counterparts in Mexico and Central America as part of a larger plan to combat drug trafficking. But it failed to dismantle criminal organizations or restore security; instead, since the agreement was signed, Mexico has experienced some of the worst violence it has ever seen. Immigration was not completely ignored on Friday: Both sides said the migrant crisis was discussed during the talks, including over breakfast with President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said at a news conference that collaboration between the United States and Mexico in managing migrants “has never been stronger” and suggested that both countries would enlist other regional leaders to assist, in part by focusing on the broader economic and social issues driving migration.  “We want the Mexico-U.S. relationship to be about more, much more, than immigration and security,” Mr. Blinken said. But officials said the new security agreement would mostly address how to stop human traffickers and other criminal smugglers instead of the wider problem of refugees and economic migrants stuck at the border. Mexico’s foreign secretary, Marcelo Ebrard, said the new bilateral agreement — a three-year deal is expected to be completed in January — could be a robust framework to create more jobs in Mexico and Central America while strengthening security cooperation. By focusing on development, Mexican officials believe the new agreement could also help stem migration to the United States. “For Mexico, it is a priority to reopen activities at the border,” Mr. Ebrard said, referring to a decision last year by the United States to close land crossings at the border with Mexico to stem the spread of the coronavirus. “They know it’s a priority, however it was not the objective of today’s meeting.” In Washington on Friday, 15 Democratic senators and Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, urged Mr. Blinken and Alejandro N. Mayorkas, the Homeland Security secretary, to ensure that Haitian migrants are protected — both those attempting to enter the United States and those deported. Recent images of U.S. Border Patrol officers on horseback corralling Haitian migrants in Texas were met with widespread anger and drew added attention to a broken immigration system. “Ensuring the integrity of U.S. borders is of utmost importance, and is not incompatible with the fundamental duty to respect the dignity, humanity and rights of all individuals seeking entry to the United States,” the senators wrote in a letter Friday. On Friday, the Biden administration raised the refugee admissions target to 125,000 for 2022. “A robust refugee admissions program is a cornerstone of the president’s commitment to rebuilding a safe, orderly, and humane migration system,” Mr. Blinken said in a statement. Mexican officials hope the new security agreement will focus less on going head-to-head with drug traffickers and instead look at the causes of addiction — treating it as a medical issue, not a criminal one — and address the dire economic conditions that propel underemployed youth to join drug organizations. The Mérida Initiative partly focused on what is known as the “kingpin strategy” to capture or kill leading drug traffickers.  But it failed to stamp out the flow of drugs from Mexico and Central America, and the next generation of traffickers was ready to take the place of those captured or killed. Mexico’s priority at the talks is to find a way to reduce the astronomical levels of violence that have swept the country since the inception of the Mérida Initiative. In 2008, 12.6 murders were recorded for every 100,000 people in Mexico; by 2018 that number had soared to 29, according to World Bank data.  “The Mexicans want to say we ended this thing, we ended this thing that kicked off a very violent chapter for Mexico,” said Carin Zissis, the editor in chief of the Americas Society and Council of the Americas. The violence is the result of two factors, analysts believe: the Mérida Initiative’s focus on all-out war with drug gangs and lax gun laws in the United States that have led to thousands of weapons being smuggled into Mexico and Central America each year.  During the Obama administration, the United States cut some security funding over concerns about human rights abuses by Mexico’s government. Those concerns have not abated: Last year, the State Department concluded in its annual human rights report that Mexican security forces and other government officials had tortured prisoners, engaged in arbitrary arrests, committed violence against journalists and exploited children for labor. A sign of how the negotiations are progressing, Ms. Zissis said, will be whether agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration are allowed to work in Mexico again. Mexico has withheld visas for D.E.A. agents since the arrest last year of Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda in California, a former defense minister, on suspicion of aiding drug traffickers. The arrest set off outrage within the Mexican government, which demanded the general’s extradition and then moved to curb cooperation with the D.E.A. Ahead of Friday’s talks, Mr. Blinken, Mr. Mayorkas and Attorney General Merrick B. Garland met with Mexico’s president. “There are other times in history where we distanced ourselves, but there are also things that unite us,” Mr. López Obrador said at the presidential palace. “We need to understand each other.” Advertisement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On Friday, he finally came down. By Ashley Wong and Chelsia Rose Marcius The police arrived at Roody Thomas’s home in Queens shortly before 1 p.m. Wednesday for what seemed like a typical call of a domestic disturbance. But when officers knocked on the door, Mr. Thomas, 44, escaped onto the roof of his home and then climbed into a nearby tree, where he perched on a cluster of branches about 30 feet in the air for more than 48 hours. The episode came to an end around 5 p.m. Friday, when the police — who tried to coax Mr. Thomas down with hostage negotiators, loud music and drones — appeared to relent and left the block. When they were gone, Mr. Thomas climbed out of the tree and into a second-floor window. Mr. Thomas was wanted on an earlier assault charge, the police said. He was not arrested after coming down Friday afternoon, and it was not clear whether he would face charges related to his time in the tree. Neighbors — many of whom said they knew Mr. Thomas — had gathered since Wednesday to watch the scene unfold. Many of them appeared to support Mr. Thomas, with some saying he had experienced mental health problems in the past. Reba Perry, a neighbor who is a police chaplain, said the call was being treated as an “E.D.P.” situation — a term used to describe an emotionally disturbed person. In a brief interview inside his home, Mr. Thomas said he was “not good at all” after spending almost three days in the tree. “It was like a death situation that I was looking at right in front of my eyes,” he said before launching into a rambling account of an arrest several years ago after an episode involving a neighbor. Mr. Thomas said he had been living in the house, on 145th Avenue in the Brookville area, since junior high school. He said that a mistrust of law enforcement authorities that dated to time spent in jail at Rikers Island had led him to climb the tree on Wednesday. “This actually started years ago,” he said. The episode occurred as New York City officials grapple with how best to respond to police calls involving people experiencing mental health crises. Such calls have sometimes turned deadly. This week, a police sergeant faced a disciplinary hearing over the 2016 shooting death of Deborah Danner, a schizophrenic woman who had refused to leave her bedroom. “This person should be addressed as a person that has an emotional or mental problem or issue,” said Sabine French, who lives 10 minutes away from Mr. Thomas in Queens and spoke with him on Thursday. “And that was not happening.” Robin Hernandez, who has lived in the neighborhood for about a decade, said she had seen Mr. Thomas jogging around the block in the past. She was one of about 30 neighbors who had gathered a few houses away over the past few days, sitting and watching quietly from patio chairs or cars, waiting to see whether Mr. Thomas would come down from the tree or be forced out. On Friday, two officers spent much of the day on the roof of Mr. Thomas’s house about 10 feet below where he was sitting, shirtless with a blanket dangling from the branches nearby. At least 40 more officers were assembled below. Several neighbors said that the police had flown drones with loud sirens over the house from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m., trying to drive Mr. Thomas out of the tree with the noise. Guy Bruno, who said he had lived a block from Mr. Thomas since 1998, said he had seen him asking to speak to a Black officer on Wednesday. A Black officer briefly came to the window to speak with him, Mr. Bruno said, but when the officer left, Mr. Thomas, who is Black, became upset. That seemed to be the moment when he decided to stay put, Mr. Bruno said. “I thought it would be over already,” Mr. Bruno said. “I didn’t expect it to be this long. I thought it would be a quick thing.” Ms. French, who is also the Queens borough advocate, said that Ms. Perry, the police chaplain, had called asking for her help, since Ms. French, like Mr. Thomas, is Haitian. She said he was talkative and relaxed when she spoke to him in Haitian Creole for about an hour on Thursday. Although he was laughing and joking, Ms. French said, when she asked whether he would come down from the tree to eat, he told her he would not until the police left. He also told her repeatedly that he was feeling intense stress. The officers, Mr. French said, should have ceded the situation to mental health professionals on the first day. She added that she did not understand why the police used hostage-negotiation specialists to deal with someone experiencing emotional distress. “I feel as if the N.Y.P.D. is not acknowledging mental illness,” Ms. French said. A police spokesman declined to answer questions about the episode or whether Mr. Thomas would be arrested. The Police Department has been trying to shift away from a police-first response to mental illness calls, announcing a new plan last November to dispatch mental health crisis workers in such emergencies. In June, the city began a program in Harlem that sends paramedics and social workers rather than officers on some mental health calls. But in most instances, officers are still the first ones to answer most mental health calls, and the Police Department has been slow to discipline those who have used deadly force in situations involving people in emotional distress.

By Daniel Politi BUENOS AIRES — A court in Argentina has dismissed a criminal case against Vice President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner that accused her of conspiring with Iran to cover up that country’s suspected involvement in a 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires. The ruling, issued late Thursday, was the latest twist in a legal drama that took a shocking turn in 2015 when the prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, died from a gunshot wound the night before he was scheduled to present what he described as explosive evidence against Mrs. Kirchner, then the president. The bombing investigation and Mr. Nisman’s death have been a source of frenzied speculation and political infighting in Argentina in recent years, raising troubling questions about the politicization of the judicial system. The unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel is the latest courtroom victory for Mrs. Kirchner, who governed the country from 2007 to 2015. It follows a pattern of Argentina’s judiciary showing leniency toward politicians when they are in power and heightened scrutiny when they leave office. As legal cases against Mrs. Kirchner have fizzled, the president who succeeded her, Mauricio Macri, a center-right politician voted out of office in 2019, has become the target of a politically charged investigation. This week, a judge ordered Mr. Macri to testify regarding allegations that his government illegally spied on the families of crew members of a submarine that sank in 2017. The bombing case stems from a memorandum of understanding Argentina and Iran signed in 2013. It called for the two countries to set up a joint commission to investigate the 1994 bombing of the Argentina Israelite Mutual Association, which killed 85 people. The agreement would have allowed an Argentine judge to travel to Iran to interrogate those accused of planning the bombing, whom Tehran had refused to extradite. The agreement never came into effect and was ultimately declared unconstitutional in 2015. Critics assailed Mrs. Kirchner for negotiating with a government that many Argentines suspected of shielding the masterminds of the attack. Iran has long denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Nisman, who had been appointed to jump-start the languishing investigation into the bombing, claimed the memo was part of a plan by Mrs. Kirchner and other high-ranking officials to trade impunity for a group of Iranian officials accused of playing a role in the bombing in exchange for commercial deals. The prosecutor said it amounted to “treason.” Mrs. Kirchner has said negotiating with Iran was the only way to move forward with an investigation that had been paralyzed for years. After Mr. Nisman was found dead on Jan. 18, 2015, the bombing case stalled in the courts until a judge in 2017 indicted Mrs. Kirchner and other officials in her former administration. (Mr. Nisman’s death remains unsolved.) In its ruling on Thursday, the three-judge panel said that the case should not go to trial because the agreement with Iran, regardless of its merits, “did not constitute a crime.” The decision infuriated families of the victims and Jewish groups in Argentina. “We’ve been waiting for three years for them to set a date for the trial, and now they decide that it isn’t a crime?” Tomás Farini Duggan, a lawyer representing family members of the victims, said in a local radio interview. Mr. Duggan predicted the case would eventually reach the Supreme Court. Jewish leaders said they looked forward to having a day in court. “Of course we don’t agree with this decision; in order to determine whether there was a crime or not, there must be a trial first,” said Jorge Knoblovits, the head of the Delegación de Asociaciones Israelitas Argentinas, which represents more than 100 Jewish organizations in Argentina. Allies of Mrs. Kirchner and her co-defendants in the case saw the ruling as vindication. “It was the first time in six years that we were heard by impartial judges,” said one defendant, Juan Martín Mena, who is now deputy justice minister. Mrs. Kirchner continues to face unrelated charges in several corruption investigations. A separate case that accused her of defrauding the government through the dollar futures market was dismissed this year. Mr. Macri is also facing several corruption-related investigations that his allies have characterized as persecution by judges friendly with the current administration. The tit-for-tat nature of the accusations has meant that courthouses have often become the stage for political fights to play out. “Pursuing judicial cases has become an instrument of politics to attack a rival,” said Catalina Smulovitz, a political science professor at the Universidad Torcuato di Tella in Buenos Aires. “This doesn’t just erode the reputation of the people who are implicated, but it really erodes the prestige and perception of how well the justice system functions as a whole.” Advertisement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By Jesus Jiménez An Illinois woman will spend four days in jail and will be barred for a year from Yellowstone National Park for not moving out of the way of a grizzly bear and three cubs while visiting the park in May. The woman, Samantha Dehring, 25, of Carol Stream, Ill., pleaded guilty to “willfully remaining, approaching, and photographing wildlife within 100 yards,” Bob Murray, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Wyoming, announced on Thursday. While visiting Roaring Mountain at Yellowstone on May 10, Ms. Dehring and others saw a grizzly bear with three cubs, according to the U.S. attorney’s office. Others at the park backed away from the bears and returned to their vehicles, but Ms. Dehring did not retreat and took pictures of the animals, the U.S. attorney’s office said. Ms. Dehring appeared on Wednesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark L. Carman, who sentenced her to the brief jail term and issued the park ban. She was also sentenced to one year of unsupervised probation and was ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and make a $1,000 community service payment to the Yellowstone Forever Wildlife Protection Fund. “The park is not a zoo where animals can be viewed within the safety of a fenced enclosure,” Mr. Murray said in a statement, adding that while in their natural habitat, wild animals will react when they feel threatened. “Approaching a sow grizzly with cubs is absolutely foolish,” he said. “Here, pure luck is why Dehring is a criminal defendant and not a mauled tourist.” Ms. Dehring also faced another count of feeding, touching, teasing, frightening or intentionally disturbing wildlife, but it was dismissed. In a statement, Ethan Morris, a lawyer representing Ms. Dehring, said she had “showed great remorse and regret for her actions throughout this case.” Mr. Morris added that Ms. Dehring had received “constant online abuse” since video of her encounter with the bears circulated online. “While we understand that the court must send a message to deter others from violating park regulations, it is unfortunate that the district attorney’s office chose to single Ms. Dehring out,” Mr. Morris said. “Nevertheless, we accept the judgment and sentence of the court and hope this case serves as an opportunity for park visitors and staff to take steps to prevent something like this from happening again.” Ms. Dehring’s visit to Yellowstone came at a time when people were exploring national parks at record rates. Yellowstone set visitation records in May, hosting 483,159 visitors, as other popular parks like Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona and Joshua Tree National Park in California also drew large crowds. Yellowstone National Park officials declined to comment about the arrest. Yellowstone regulations prohibit visitors from “willfully remaining near or approaching wildlife, including nesting birds, within any distance that disturbs or displaces the animal.” Visitors are advised to stay 25 yards from large animals such as bison, elk, bighorn sheep, deer, moose and coyotes and at least 100 yards from bears and wolves. In April, a 40-year-old man was attacked by a grizzly bear just west of Yellowstone. Emergency responders arrived to help the man, but he later died of his injuries.

38,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/07/well/family/divorce-living-together.html,Can a Good-Enough Marriage Make for a Great Divorce? - The New York Times,"Oct. 7, 2021","Advertisement Supported by In continuing to share a home, along with our teenage kids, my ex and I have found true partnership. By Kimberly Harrington My future ex-husband and I thought our post-separation, pre-divorce living arrangement — together, in the same house, with our kids — was temporary, so we didn’t think to make rules. When we had agreed to split we didn’t know what might come next, but we did know we weren’t modeling for our kids what a good marriage should look like. With our shared desire to spend as much time as possible with our teenagers before they left home, we wondered if our lack of fiery conflict could pay off in an unexpected way. Maybe we could model what a good partnership looked like. I still did the laundry and folded the clothes because it’s the one thing I’ve done throughout my life that gives me a sense of mindless, tangible completion. He continued to make most of the meals, a shift in labor that happened after I tearfully exploded for what felt like the hundredth time, trying to explain that the person who had the palate of a 5-year-old, hated cooking, and would never learn how, because there were other things I wanted to do with my life, was not the person who should be cooking for our children. Especially given that he was an excellent cook. I continued to pay all the bills from our joint account and we still pooled the majority of our money. I kept him (and our children) as a beneficiary on all my accounts, policies and benefits. I have no intention of leaving him high and dry should anything happen to me. That is not how our marriage worked. He allowed me to work as hard as I could, and I encouraged him to pursue a job that would make him happy, no matter how much it paid. I stopped inserting myself into or facilitating his communication with his family. In general, I took myself out of the Head of Communications role as well as Chief Birthday Present Buyer and Happy Anniversary Caller and Human Walking Reminder Lady. It felt as good as it sounds. We went to school events, parties and other gatherings together. We saw our friends separately, but we had always done that. We had never been a couple nor a family who always did everything together all the time, so in that respect not much changed. I stopped going camping with the family. I didn’t hate camping, but I didn’t love it enough to keep going when opting out and having a weekend to myself was an option. One of our closest friends, Dabbs, started going in my place. Whenever they’re all on camping trips together, I think about how other campers probably assume they’re a double-dad family or, to my endless delight, a Double Dabbs family. *** The summer after we announced our divorce, I glanced down at his iPad on the kitchen counter when an email came up on his locked screen. He was at work. The email was from a woman I didn’t know. The first few lines that were visible said that, yes, she actually might take that golf class with him and my son. What in the hell is this. I thought I didn’t care what he did and I would be happy for him when he moved on, because I was now an Evolved Person. Instead I was shocked at how flashy and visceral my jealousy was. He could move on after I moved on! I would be happy for him after I was happy for myself first! We texted back and forth in a delicate flurry. He said she was just a friend and of course he would have told me if anything was going on. We agreed to this as our first rule: If anything happens dating-wise, there needs to be a conversation. We agreed that that would probably be the beginning of the end of this little living arrangement (and this is still our assumption). A couple of months later, he was cleaning up after having ripped up all the carpet in our former guest room upstairs, now my new bedroom. It was a surprise birthday present for me, getting the floor prepped and ready to paint. I was sitting on the floor, scrolling through my phone as it charged, and realized that, per our agreement, I should tell him I had joined Tinder that afternoon. So I did. “OK” was the entirety of his reaction. I never ended up going on a single real date, so I never told him anything that happened while I was on any dating apps. The whole experience was so weird and theoretical and stupid. But when he read my manuscript for an essay collection about divorce, one of the things he was most upset by was my dating app story. He said, “We had agreed we would tell each other if we were dating anyone.” And I reminded him that almost being scammed by an anonymous stranger is not dating. We agreed to disagree. *** As our living situation continues, a curious shift has occurred: We ask about each other’s days and share more now than we did before. For the most part we exhibit a level of manners and appreciation more associated with longtime friendship than with longtime marriage. Sometimes all four of us will watch a show or a movie after dinner, but more often than not we are scattered to our various shows, work, books and FaceTimes with friends. We are a house of four relatively self-reliant people, and there is a communal, roommate-ish feeling to so much of our lives now. On the one hand I’m grateful for that independence, each of us with room to roam inside our own home. But I’d be lying if I didn’t say I sometimes worry about how this mirrors my own teenage years in a divorced household, especially when we each grab dinner and retreat to our own corners. I loved having the independence to do whatever I wanted, but sometimes too much freedom at that age makes you wonder if anyone cares about what you’re doing at all. Very little has changed for our kids, though, other than they get to see their parents learning to become real friends. Our approach reminds me a little of a realization I had the day after getting laid off from a job that had become a cornerstone of my identity. I had worked so hard, I had given my life over to it, I had left my small children during dinners and weekends because of that job. But what struck me the morning after I was laid off was this singular thought: “Maybe I could just do what I’m good at now instead of everything I was made to feel bad about.” Our current arrangement, our prelude to a divorce, is like that. We are just doing what we are good at and not doing the things we were bad at (mostly). From the time we’re teenagers, navigating our first romantic relationships, we dread hearing the phrase “we’re just friends.” Our culture reinforces the idea that friendship is a lower, less desirable, and less meaningful form of relationship than marriage. But, depending on the marriage and the two people involved, there is enormous potential to demonstrate to our friends, families, and especially our children that sometimes marriages can do more than dissolve. They have the power to evolve. This essay was adapted from “But You Seemed So Happy” by Kimberly Harrington. Copyright © 2021 by Kimberly Harrington.

39,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/parenting/safe-space-kids-talk.html,How to Help Kids Open Up About Anything - The New York Times,"Oct. 15, 2020","Advertisement Supported by Tips for creating safe spaces and developing emotional intelligence in your children. By Shanicia Boswell “Did you learn your lesson?” my mother asked. Those five words have been etched in my mind since I was a teenager. I was a good kid but, between boys and shenanigans with my friends, I was always pushing the boundaries. This time, I had received a speeding ticket for rushing to get home before my curfew. When I told her what had happened, my mother approached me with arms crossed, her tone one of serious concern, but not anger. I received no actual punishment, but I did have to take responsibility for my actions and pay the ticket with my own money. Growing up, I always found my mother to be a safe space for me. Now that I’m a mother, I’ve worked to create those spaces for my daughter. The communication that starts with parents and children is one of the most influential and persuasive ways children can learn to socialize throughout their lives, research shows. Taylor Quick, a licensed child therapist for Zola Counseling, a private practice in Charlotte, N.C., defines safe spaces as the relationship that a child has to her parent or caregiver to feel understood and heard. In her work with children between the ages of 2 and 12, Quick said she has observed that children feel more empowered “after their feelings have been validated.” How do we create safe spaces to allow our children to manage their emotions and talk openly? Lenaya Smith-Crawford, a licensed marriage, family and play therapist at Kaleidoscope Family Therapy in Atlanta, said she starts every family session with a “feelings check-in.” “I want the children and the family to identify and be aware of the feelings that they’ve experienced throughout their week but also be able to connect that feeling with a certain circumstance or event.” Smith-Crawford suggested parents try this with their children. “Ideally, feelings check-ins are done daily, at the end of the day. You can do this with your children until they are adults,” she said. Self-awareness, or knowing what you feel and how you feel it, is an important component of emotional intelligence, said Daniel Goleman, Ph.D, the author of “Emotional Intelligence and Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships.” Showing children how to calm down, stay focused on a goal and remain optimistic despite setbacks is another aspect of emotional intelligence, Dr. Goleman said. When my daughter is frustrated and trying to explain herself, I make her take big breaths in and out before continuing. We stop everything, breathe, calm down, and then I allow her to speak. Dr. Goleman has demonstrated how younger children have the power to manage their emotions in an exercise he calls Belly Buddies. “Children get their favorite stuffed animal, find a place on the carpet to lie down, put it on their belly, and watch it rise and fall on each breath. It’s focusing on mindfulness because the same neural circuitry that helps you concentrate and focus, also calms your physiology. This gives them a way to do it on their own. It empowers the child.” My 7-year-old and I have a safety circle. In this circle, we sit face to face to create a feeling of equalness. She is allowed to share anything with me without the fear of consequence — unless it is against one of our “limits,” which include stealing, hurting someone else, intentional lying, and not taking responsibility for her actions, the last one a lesson I took from the speeding ticket. “It is important to make sure you are setting firm, clear limits and you are staying consistent with those limits after you connect with the child,” said Quick. By staying in those boundaries, I am letting my daughter know that even though she can express herself freely, she still has a responsibility to be a good person. Our safety circle is an imaginary place. A safe space can be a physical place, like a calming corner, but it’s more important that it be an emotional space between parent and child so that no matter where you are, you can connect. We begin with a hug and breathing to calm ourselves. Then, I allow her to speak openly. Sloane Anderson, 7, of Atlanta, a friend of my daughter’s, showed me two safe spaces where she sits to talk with her parents: her top bunk, and a corner in her room that she calls her “school corner.” I asked her what she likes to talk about with her parents. “I like to talk to them about mistakes I’ve made and stuff like that,” she said. “My parents listen to me because they want to support me and they want to be there for me.” “If your child is crying, instead of assuming they are sad, ask descriptive questions around what they feel, how it happened, and why they feel as they do,” Smith-Crawford said. “The child may discover that the emotion they feel is frustration instead of sadness. ” Recently, I asked my daughter several times to put on her night clothes, and she became upset because she could hear the frustration in my voice after I asked her for the third time. She kept telling me she didn’t want to make me sad. I sat down with her and explained the differences between anger, sadness and frustration. I gave her several scenarios and had her match each one with the correct emotion. For example, “If you lost your favorite stuffed animal and could not get it back, would it make you mad, sad or frustrated?” This quick exercise allowed her to identify exactly how she or others might feel versus describing one emotion to describe a plethora of feelings. “Instead of giving them the feelings words, you are asking them to engage in the process of elimination and really connect with their exact emotions,” said Smith-Crawford, Tuning in to other people with empathy and sensing what they’re feeling are also important parts of emotional intelligence, Dr. Goleman said. In his book “No Excuses! The Power of Self Discipline,” Brian Tracy challenges his readers to imagine what their lives would be like if they were their own parent. He asks parents to identify their own strengths and weaknesses. Or, he suggests, we can ask our children how we are doing as parents. I often ask my daughter how I’m doing as a mom and if there is anything that she needs more of. Once, she told me I spent too much time on my phone when we were supposed to be watching a movie together. Now, I limit checking my phone when we watch movies — even if we are on our 18th viewing of Frozen — and she creates fewer distractions to get my attention. When situations may be too challenging for children to verbalize what they are experiencing, consider talking to your child in writing. My daughter and I keep a journal where we share our day-to-day thoughts. It allows her to express freely without interruption and helps her to read my thoughts as well. Letter writing also comes in handy for apologies. If your child misbehaves, have her write a letter of apology and read it aloud. Then acknowledge the apology with hugs and warmth. The letter becomes a safe space. It is never too late to start opening new communication channels with your child, especially as we are spending so much more time together during the pandemic. By helping our children talk openly at home, we are preparing them to communicate and connect with others and to use their voice powerfully in the world.

40,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/06/well/family/sensitive-child.html,"Is Your Child an Orchid, a Tulip or a Dandelion? - The New York Times","Aug. 6, 2020","Advertisement Supported by Highly sensitive children, like orchids, thrive in the right environment, experts say. By Richard Schiffman The new mother from a rural area near Burlington, Vt., noticed that her toddler’s behavior didn’t seem to fit the descriptions in the child-rearing books she was reading. Her daughter would burst into tears when she heard a loud bird call or a person singing out of tune, or if she wore scratchy clothes. And she always demanded to be carried by her mother and never left alone. These constant demands were exhausting. The mother worried that there might be something wrong. Then she came across a book that described what psychologists increasingly call “the highly sensitive child.” “The description fit perfectly. It helped me to realize that things are going to be a little different with her and I need to accept that,” she said. She asked to be identified only by her first name, Alicia, because she doesn’t want her daughter, now 4, to be saddled with the label “highly sensitive” for the rest of her life. Being sensitive is often viewed as a weakness in our culture, which values more assertive traits. Yet Alicia has come to look on her child’s sensitivity as a gift — though it is clearly not without its challenges. Sensitive children are keen observers of the world, but tend to get overstimulated. They often live intense inner lives and are highly creative, but they are wary of new situations and of people they don’t know. They also easily intuit the moods of others and feel their pain. This empathy draws their peers and sometimes even adults to confide in sensitive children. Later in life, they often go into helping professions like health care and counseling, where their natural gifts are put to good use. Roughly one in five children are highly sensitive, according to the research psychologist Elaine Aron, whose 1996 book “The Highly Sensitive Person” popularized the term. Dr. Aron developed a 23-question test, which is often used to help determine whether or not a child is highly sensitive. Sensitivity is an inborn temperament, she says, that comes hard-wired and remains with highly sensitive people for their whole lives. Michael Pluess, a professor of developmental psychology at Queen Mary University of London, has found that our life experiences, particularly those early in life, also have a big impact. “We found that about 50 percent of differences in sensitivity between people are due to genetic factors, the other half by environment, including the prenatal environment,” Dr. Pluess said. He said people fall roughly into three groups: highly sensitive, whom he calls “orchids,” which are beautiful flowers that need very particular environments to thrive; hardy “dandelions,” which can grow virtually anywhere; and a middle group — the largest — “tulips,” which fall somewhere between the two extremes of the sensitivity scale. “The idea is not that one is better and one is worse,” Dr. Pluess explained, “but that these are different personalities, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses.” He added: “It is important to communicate consistently to the child that their sensitivity isn’t a problem, that it’s a strength so that they can develop a healthy sense of what they can do well.” He has found that highly sensitive people benefit more than less sensitive people from positive experiences. In a 2015 study of adolescent girls in Britain, he found that those who were highly sensitive proved to be more responsive to therapy for depression than those who were less sensitive. But the flip side is that highly sensitive people are also more easily traumatized by painful experiences as children and sometimes by a simple lack of adult understanding. Tracy Cooper, a researcher at Baker University in Baldwin City, Kan., who identifies as a highly sensitive person himself, says the brains of such people have unique characteristics. Brain imaging studies have shown that they “have higher levels of activity in the mirror neurons, which has to do with empathy and socialization, and there is more connectivity across different segments of the brain, which informs creativity,” he said. Their emotional openness can make highly sensitive children want to escape from feeling overwhelmed at parties and family gatherings. They can also have trouble adjusting to the bustle of the classroom, as Dr. Cooper remembers when he was “that weird kid in the back who is drawing pictures and seems totally tuned out, you know all the answers, but you’ll never raise your hand.” For those sensitive children who tend to get overwhelmed at school and in other group activities, the pandemic has offered a welcomed respite, giving them some breathing space “to explore, create, read and think on their own,” Dr. Cooper said. Others, however, actually prefer routines like attending school, he added, because “the predictable structure helps alleviate their anxieties about what to expect.” In general, Dr. Cooper believes that many sensitive children have adjusted extremely well to the current restrictions. “Sensitive children may be incredibly resilient, adaptable, and able to digest circumstances better than some adults,” he observed. Research has shown that boys are highly sensitive in roughly the same numbers as girls. But boys who violate cultural norms of masculinity may “suffer more shame and rejection, even violence and anger directed toward them” at school, according to Dr. Cooper. It is important to honor sensitive boys’ greater need to spend down time alone, he added, and not to force them into competitive activities like team sports if they choose to opt out. Teachers who are not familiar with high sensitivity sometimes mistake it for other conditions, including social phobia, autism spectrum disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Sensitivity is also sometimes confused with being shy. While the majority of highly sensitive children are introverts, roughly 30 percent are extroverts, despite their tendency to get easily overstimulated in social situations. “Educators are often surprised to hear about how stressful it is for these students to be in a school-based setting,” said Candy Crawford, a therapist who conducts workshops with schools in the Chicago area to help staff members understand the special needs of highly sensitive people. “I tell them that when these kids are feeling anxious, they should be allowed to stand up, walk around, get a drink of water.” When Dr. Judith Orloff, a clinical psychiatrist at the University of California, Los Angeles, was growing up, she couldn’t go into shopping malls or crowded places without leaving feeling anxious or depressed. Adults told her to “toughen up.” It was the wrong advice, she says. “Tell your sensitive children it’s likely they’re picking up another person’s emotions. Teach them to take a few deep breaths, visualize a relaxing scene, calm down,” Dr. Orloff advised. Sometimes you simply need to remove sensitive children from situations that distress them, she said: “Help them accept their beautiful abilities and not to be overstimulated, rather than suppressing their traits with antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs.” Alane Freund, a family therapist in San Rafael, Calif., has pioneered a form of equine assisted therapy to help highly sensitive teenagers better appreciate their own traits. Horses are highly sensitive by nature. “A horse can sense your muscle tension from the far side of the corral,” Ms. Freund said. “They know if your breathing changes, they can smell your perspiration. That extreme sensitivity is how they stay alive in the wild.” Like horses, highly sensitive children will tend to enter new situations more slowly. “Horses model for the children that caution is healthy,” Ms. Freund said. “You don’t know these people, you’ve got to get the lay of the land first.” Recently, she received a text message from a highly sensitive 16-year-old client saying, “I suck at making friends.” Ms. Freund wrote back: “You don’t suck at making friends. You make friends in a different way, you are actually better at it because you take time, choose the right person, forge deeper friendships in the end.” Advertisement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/parenting/working-moms-coronavirus-child-care-shortage.html,"Moms Are Back to Work, But Child Care Resources Are ‘Laughable’ - The New York Times","Oct. 6, 2021","Advertisement Supported by The NYT Parenting Newsletter Yearlong waiting lists, babysitters nowhere to be found, and families feeling the strain. By Jessica Grose Katy Stenta, the pastor of a small church in Albany, N.Y., and the mother of three boys, has experienced pandemic-related child-care shortages from all sides. She helps run a nursery school out of her Presbyterian church, and the newest aide they hired keeps missing work because her child has asthma. Ms. Stenta, 38, has been filling in for her. The pastor’s three sons have a range of caretaking needs. Her oldest child, 13, has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Her middle child, 11, has autism, A.D.H.D. and stomach issues that require extra support. Her youngest, 9, has a reading disability. A respite caregiver, who is paid by the state, helps with her son with autism for 12 hours a week, but that worker cannot legally help with the other two children. Ms. Stenta’s family has not been able to find a babysitter who can take all three children to the two different schools they attend. Both because it’s difficult to find someone who can handle her 11-year-old’s complex needs and also, since the pandemic began, the supply of babysitters has “completely dried up,” she said. So Ms. Stenta and her husband, who is a children’s librarian, spend about three hours each day shuttling their children back and forth to school. “The last thing we want to do is quit our jobs, but we have to take care of our kids,” she said — not that quitting is a serious option for either of them. “We’re not bringing home big bucks serving the community.”  Even before the pandemic, Ms. Stenta said that she had to have a flexible job to deal with her family’s considerable caregiving needs — and that’s common among parents whose children have disabilities. Though her church is understanding, juggling work and child-care has been incredibly hard for her and her husband. Ms. Stenta’s situation is a common one at this stage in the pandemic. When Covid-19 shutdowns hit the United States in March 2020, it was a shock to the entire labor force, though mothers with school-age children were disproportionately affected. They were more likely to take leave from their jobs or exit the work force entirely than fathers or people without children were, according to data analysis by Misty Heggeness, a principal economist and senior adviser at the U.S. Census Bureau. While many of these mothers have returned to the work force, somewhere between 900,000 and one million have stopped working to support their families, and according to Ms. Heggeness, these mothers tend to be in dual-income households where their families could survive on one salary. In single-parent families and families that need two incomes to keep the lights on, mothers have returned to their jobs — but they have done so while day care and aftercare options are scarcer than they were prepandemic. Though moms have not left the labor market in droves, “I think that makes it more worrisome,” said Ms. Heggeness. “Because it means over the past two years you have this core group of women who have essentially been doing double duty 24/7 and not getting recognized for it. Nobody’s coming to rescue them.” As my colleague Claire Cain Miller pointed out, day care centers are operating at 88 percent capacity compared to 2019, and even “before the pandemic, child care did not cover everyone who needed it.” There were not enough spots, and for a quarter of families with children under 6, the cost of care was more than 10 percent of family income. In Covid times, everything is worse. In a series of surveys performed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation in 2020, two-thirds of working parents said they changed their child-care arrangement because of the pandemic, and the majority of those parents were still struggling to find a permanent solution, according to Caitlin Codella, vice president of policy and programs at the foundation. The struggle to find care is particularly acute in rural areas. This was a major problem before the pandemic — 3 in 5 rural communities lacked adequate child care supply, according to a 2018 report from the Center for American Progress, a progressive policy institute. Brittany Lynch, 35, a mother of an almost 9-year-old and a 5-year-old, who lives outside Lyons, Colo., a town of under 2,000 residents near Rocky Mountain National Park, said that the waiting list for day care “is laughable, if you have a twisted sense of humor.” In 2020, she tried to find a child-care spot for her daughter, who was then 3, in Lyons and nearby Estes Park, and was told the waiting lists were over a year long, by which time her daughter would be in kindergarten. She couldn’t get a babysitter to come out to her house, up winding mountain roads, either. Ms. Lynch works as a project manager at a lighting design firm in Boulder, and even though her whole team was telecommuting during the pandemic, she arranged to go into the office, a 40-minute drive each way, because she found a spot in a day care center near work for her daughter. She did not really trust this day care place, but said it was better than nothing. (Ms. Lynch described it as “sketchy” and said that there was a lot of staff turnover.) Even with that plan in place, there were points during the pandemic when she had to cut back on work to care for her daughter, and when she worked fewer hours she was paid less. As she and her husband, who is an architect, are still paying back student loans, money is tight. “I am a white, middle class, superaverage person,” she said. “If I struggle this much, I can’t even imagine what it’s like when it comes to others who don’t have it like me.” According to data from the Rapid-EC project, an ongoing, national survey about the well-being of parents and children during the pandemic, parents’ levels of emotional distress shot up at the beginning of the pandemic. Save for a brief respite in the spring of 2021, before the Delta variant surge, levels have remained elevated by 10 to 15 percentage points compared to prepandemic measurements. “Emotional distress” levels are calculated by asking parents a variety of questions about depression, anxiety, loneliness and stress, said Philip Fisher, the director of the University of Oregon Center for Translational Neuroscience and the lead investigator on the Rapid-EC project. Though parents of all backgrounds and income levels are much more distressed than they were before the pandemic, single parents, parents living in poverty and parents of children with disabilities are particularly emotionally taxed, Dr. Fisher said. “Uncertainty is the toxic ingredient” on top of everything else right now for parents, he said. They’re worried about the state of the world, their ability to do their jobs and the virus that still looms. “Child care is one piece of that,” Dr. Fisher said — parents know it can disappear at any moment and upend their fragile balance. Jacqueline Sievert, 36, thought she had finally solved her day care problems when she found a spot for her 14-month-old child after being on waiting lists for months in Hamburg, N.Y., just outside of Buffalo. A few days before her son was supposed to start at the center, she got a message telling her that the day care was closed immediately and indefinitely. Ms. Sievert looked up the center on the website for New York State’s Office of Children and Family Services and found that its license had been suspended indefinitely for multiple serious violations, including children left without “competent supervision.” This week, Ms. Sievert’s mother is watching her son, but that’s not a workable solution for her and her husband. “I’m not sure what we’ll do next week now; we’re piecing it together. Neither of us have careers where we can easily watch an active 1-year-old for the entire day,” she said. Ms. Sievert manages a team at a commercial bank and her husband is an operations lead at a large company. About three hundred miles east in Albany, Ms. Stenta said that she and her husband are “exhausted.” She doesn’t know what the fix might be to secure day care services for her sons in the near term. They don’t live near extended family, and making child care arrangements has always been more of a hardship for parents of children with disabilities, even in nonpandemic times. “There’s certainly no social structures in place for this,” Ms. Stenta said.

By Alex Marshall WARSAW — The vast fields of Warsaw’s Bemowo airport have hosted concerts by some of the world’s biggest stars. Michael Jackson played there. So did Madonna. Metallica, too. But last Saturday more than 30,000 people — many young teenagers, with their parents acting as chaperones — crowded together next to the runway waiting for a new star to get onstage: Michal Matczak, a 21-year-old rapper with bleached-blond hair and a constant grin, better known as Mata. “He’s like the representative of our generation,” said Joseph Altass, 20, a student who’d traveled from Gdynia, more than 200 miles north of Warsaw, for the concert. Zuzia Waskiewicz, 19, sharing a bottle of flavored vodka with a friend, agreed: “He’s the first person talking about real things about us.” When Mata appeared at 8 p.m., it was clear he was speaking to the younger generation in the audience: One of the night’s first tracks, “Blok,” was about moving out from his parents’ home and annoying his new neighbors by partying. Then Mata played an ode to marijuana, followed by a tune about drinking on the concrete steps that line the Vistula River in Warsaw. The crowd rapped along to every word. Mata’s impact in Poland has been inescapable. Earlier this year, one of his tracks, “Kiss Cam,” was streamed so frequently, it appeared on one of Billboard’s global charts — a first for a Polish act. When last Friday he released “Mlody Matczak” (“Young Matczak”), his second album focused on his early adulthood, it instantly topped the country’s Spotify chart. Several of his songs have over 50 million views on YouTube. But one specific track marked Mata’s explosive entrance into Polish cultural life two years ago: “Patointeligencja” (an amalgam of the Polish words for pathology, and intelligentsia). Over spare production, Mata paints a picture of life as a student at Batory, an elite high school in Warsaw where many students are expected to push for admission to the world’s best universities. In his telling, few of the students are quietly studying for their final exams. Instead, they’re using drugs, alcohol and sex to deal with the pressure. “My friend wanted to spend his father’s whole salary on drugs,” Mata raps, “but his old man was making so much he would have killed himself trying.” “Patointeligencja” was a sensation almost as soon as it appeared on YouTube in December 2019. Cyryl Rozwadowski, an editor at Newonce, a popular Polish-language culture website, said “it was such a groundbreaking event, I hardly think of it as a song anymore.” Newspapers and TV shows started using the track to debate both the pressures on Polish youth and issues of privilege, like whether an apparently rich kid like Mata should be rapping at all. Their takes often reflected political divides in the country. Poland has for years been in a culture war, with liberals on one side and the ruling populist Law and Justice Party and its conservative supporters on the other, facing off over issues like gay rights, abortion and even the rule of law. Some conservative sections of the media, including the country’s main government-run TV station, presented Mata’s track as showing the dysfunctions of the liberal elite. They regularly pointed out that Mata’s father is Marcin Matczak, a lawyer and academic known for his fierce opposition to the ruling party’s policies. On his new album, Mata has a tribute to him called “Papuga,” or “Parrot,” slang for lawyer in Poland. His father has welcomed the association, this year releasing a book called “How to Raise a Rapper.” A few hours before the airport concert, Mata said in an interview at his record label’s plush office that he liked causing scandal. “I’m a bit addicted to adrenaline,” he said, adding that as an only child he craved attention. Sometimes, he feels “like an internet troll more than a rapper,” he said. But he insisted he hadn’t written “Patointeligencja” when he was 18 to cause a stir. He typed it on his phone during his final year at Batory when he’d “just had a big breakdown.” A three-year relationship had ended, he said, and he was overwhelmed with stress about exams and his teachers saying he was heading for failure. One day, he skipped class and went to a Caffe Nero, where he poured alcohol into a coffee while searching for a beat on YouTube. When he found the music for “Patointeligencja,” the lyrics angrily spilled out of him. “It was just stream of consciousness, all these bad emotions coming out of me,” he said. “Even now, I’m excited when I think about that moment. I felt alive.” When his father picked him up later, Mata rapped the tune to him. He said the song was like “the cure” for his breakdown. Soon he was writing his debut album, “100 Dni Do Matury” (“100 Days to Finals”), which reviewers later called a farewell to his childhood. He managed to graduate. “Mlody Matczak” — released last Friday — is mainly about his new life as an adult, he said, but it also includes a track cursing Polish political figures who’d criticized him and his father. There’s a song about his grandfathers, who both died this year, one of complications from Covid-19. At one of their funerals, Mata got up to sing, and the piano player asked for his autograph, he said. Critics in Poland are talking about his new album as being far more than scandal mongering. Bart Strowski, the co-author of a series of books on Polish rap, said he liked Mata’s duality. On one hand, he “is an angry young rapper filled with booze and weed.” On the other, Strowski said, he’s “a soulful and sensitive kid” writing unusual songs filled with “incredible sociological detail.” Mata said he was enjoying fame in Poland, but hoped to find success outside the country, too. He’d been thinking about whether to try rapping in English, he said, but if he did, would keep a “hard Polish accent” to stand out. At the concert on Saturday, Mata’s ambition was clear, with the show staged with the help of a theater director. During one song, he was joined by about 20 dancers in Polish folk costumes and red balaclavas. For another about submissive sex, he stood in the middle of a huge block of lights while a group of dancers took his top off and sprayed him with cream. After almost two hours, it seemed there was little spectacle left, and the only hit left to play was “Patointeligencja.” But instead of performing the song, Mata ran offstage, jumped into a blue helicopter and flew away. The crowd waited around for 10 minutes, asking whether he’d really gone, but Mata had left to find his next controversy.

By Jonathan Balcombe HURRICANE LIZARDS AND PLASTIC SQUIDThe Fraught and Fascinating Biology of Climate ChangeBy Thor Hanson When I left Canada for the United States in 1987, I had never seen or heard a red-bellied woodpecker, which at that time was a rare vagrant in southern Ontario. Today, they are firmly established here, and I have encountered several since returning to Canada in 2018. It’s no mystery why red-bellied woodpeckers are advancing northward. They’re responding to a warming planet. To which one might say: “Fine, good for them!” But in an interconnected world, where the fate of one species is inextricably linked to the fortune of another, rapid changes always carry consequences. At a time when the climate change discourse is focused mainly on its causes, its effects on weather and our so-far tepid efforts to address the problem, it’s good to see a book on how animals and plants are responding and faring amid the flux. Starving polar bears forced to swim as ice melts have become an evocative symbol of global warming. But as Thor Hanson reveals in “Hurricane Lizards and Plastic Squid,” there are subtler, less noticed dramas playing out. Take, for example, the so-called escalator to extinction, a phenomenon as sad as it is insidious. Temperature and moisture patterns change with elevation, as do the species who inhabit each terrain. On a heating planet, those animals and plants that have adapted to particular elevations are being forced to higher ground, until they reach the top and, having nowhere left to go, perish. Studies have documented this effect on birds, moths and tree seedlings, and it seems likely that other life forms, including mammals, reptiles and amphibians, are vulnerable to this upslope migration toward oblivion. With 25 percent to 85 percent of the world’s species now in the process of relocating, one wonders whether the hottest regions on earth will become barren lands, devoid of any life, like the “dead zone” in the Gulf of Mexico, which covers somewhere around 7,000 square miles. Despite the gravity of its subject, though, this is not a depressing book. An award-winning biologist and author whose earlier work has focused on bees, feathers, seeds and gorillas, Hanson is an affable guide and storyteller, with a knack for analogy, a sense of humor and the natural curiosity of a scientist. In a compact chemistry lesson using a jar of pickles and a lit match, he and his son, Noah, perform an experiment to demonstrate the power of carbon dioxide. On another occasion, he takes his hatchet to a dead pine in his yard to try to discover whether his tree is being attacked by destructive borer beetles. Elsewhere, Hanson outlines carbon dioxide’s omnipresence, its gradual subterranean conversion to fossil fuels (petroleum, coal, natural gas) and its much faster release into ecosystems when we burn those fuels. In the oceans, acidification corrodes and weakens the protective shells of tiny mollusks vital to marine food ecosystems, and sparks sensory confusion for fishes that rely on water chemistry for finding mates, meals, homes and avoiding predators. When coral reefs decline, this reduces not just food, but cover for reef denizens. In this deteriorating world, it takes some evolutionary agility for a species to avoid losing its grip on life, sometimes literally. An experiment with anole lizards demonstrates rapid natural selection favoring feet and toes better able to hold onto twigs and branches during severe storms. The diminutive reptiles cling to a stick while being subjected to close-range blasts from a leaf blower. I don’t imagine the anoles appreciated being subjected to near-hurricane-force winds (never mind the noise!), but I was pleased to see that they were all returned to the wild reportedly unharmed. If improving your grip isn’t on your to-do list, perhaps changing your wardrobe is. In Finland, the once-rare brown tawny owl is now overtaking the more typical gray one, owing to declining snow cover. I was reminded of when, as a young child, my father explained to me how the pepper moths in London, which rely on camouflage to elude hungry birds, underwent a similar transformation from white to dark gray when the Industrial Revolution plastered buildings and trees with soot. One of the core lessons here is that our climate emergency affects not just individual species but, inevitably, interspecies relationships. Witness the effects of changing climate on the interdependence of plants and birds. Consider the “timing mismatches” that occur with flowering plants. Nectar-rich flowers are hitting their peak blooming phase a week or more before hummingbirds arrive. Insect activity is also affected, with flocks of hungry swallows missing an expected insect hatch. It is only by careful population monitoring that we are likely to notice these shifts, such are the creeping effects of climate change. Temperature, of course, isn’t the only climatic variable at play: Some trees are moving south and west in pursuit of drifting moisture. Blue jays and other seed-caching birds facilitate the migration by carrying and burying seeds over long distances, some of which inevitably go unretrieved when a jay forgets or dies. But how, Hanson wonders, does a plant outrun climate change when its prime seed distributor has gone? Joshua trees lost their most important long-distance seed disperser in the giant Shasta ground sloth, whose kind went extinct following the last ice age, probably because of human predation. Whereas the lumbering sloths could excrete Joshua seeds miles from where the fruits were eaten, today the Joshuas are left with pack rats and other small mammals, whose dispersal services amount to a measly six feet per year. (I’m hoping that history’s most prodigious seed disperser, humankind, is atoning for past misdemeanors.) Although there are plenty of species declines in these pages, there are also stories of flexibility and resilience. Nimble dovekies (a.k.a. “little auks”), small, plump arctic seabirds, are not only so far surviving, but also thriving, no longer having to fly as far to find their favored food — flourishing zooplankton made accessible by melting ice. There were occasions when I was hoping for information that didn’t materialize. It’s fascinating to learn that elderberries have a more bear-friendly nutritional profile than salmon, and that Alaskan grizzly bears will abandon the salmon run to feast on these berries, which are now fruiting earlier. But I’d like to know how they sense when the time is right. Can they smell the berries from a distance, or perhaps see a blush of purple appearing on bushes upslope? The grizzlies aren’t the only ones after salmon. The author declares a passion for fishing. In doing so, he joins a sizable cadre of self-described animal-loving writers who nevertheless pursue a pastime that causes fear, pain and suffering in their quarry. There is now robust science demonstrating pain and emotion in all kinds of fishes, salmon included. The dissonance here is not just ethical but ecological. As Hanson explains, the native cutthroat trout he seeks is threatened by hybridization with rainbow trout, with which these streams have been stocked to serve the recreational demands of anglers. Which brings us to Hanson’s inspirational closing argument, that individual action drives much-needed policy change, not vice versa. While nobody can do everything, there is much that each of us can do (and not do), “tangible things like how we drive, shop, eat, travel, protest, vote,” and even, he writes, “cut the grass.” Amen.

45,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/07/arts/music/joy-crookes.html,Joy Crookes’s Introspective Soul Digs Deep Beneath Her ‘Skin’ - The New York Times,"Oct. 7, 2021","Advertisement Supported by The 22-year-old British-Irish-Bangladeshi musician is releasing a debut album that makes a strong statement about her identity. By Geneva Abdul LONDON — Joy Crookes knew she was making a statement by naming her debut album “Skin.” “It’s one of the strongest parts of our bodies,” the 22-year-old singer-songwriter said. But “in every other sense, socially and externally, it is used against us,” she added in a recent interview at her London apartment, nestled on the sofa with the Kama Sutra and a novel by Jhumpa Lahiri visible on a sparsely filled nearby shelf. “Skin,” due Oct. 15, makes an impassioned statement about her British-Irish-Bangladeshi heritage. “The thing about being mixed race is there’s so much projection,” she said. “My identity is solely my responsibility, and my choice, and I don’t need anyone’s permission.” In her music, Crookes offers listeners a nuanced and candid exploration of her multiracial identity. At a time when many conversations about race in the arts and calls for change have only recently begun, Crookes’s commitment to vulnerability in her storytelling has helped her connect with a growing — and loyal — fan base. Listening to Crookes’s soulful, intimate music can feel like intruding on a private conversation or cracking open a diary, placing her alongside introspective British artists like Arlo Parks and Cleo Sol. “Don’t you know the skin that you’re given is made to be lived in?” she sings, with a plea in her voice on the album’s bare-bones title track, quoting words she spoke to a suicidal friend over simple piano and strings. Other songs explore her experiences with sexual assault, and speak directly to Britain’s Conservative government: “No such thing as a kingdom when tomorrow’s done for the children,” she sings on the sharp-tongued, retro-tinged “Kingdom.” Growing up, Crookes — who turns 23 on Oct. 9 — bought CDs by Marvin Gaye and Kate Nash, and taught herself to play the guitar and piano, and later, to produce. She was first contacted at 15 by a music manager who saw a YouTube video of her and a friend covering “Hit The Road Jack.” At 19 she signed with an imprint of Sony Music. In the last four years, she has released three EPs and several singles, featured in a Beats campaign and landed on the 2020 shortlist for the BRIT Rising Star Award, which is given to the British act tipped to make it big in the coming year. “Every now and then you get someone who’s phenomenally talented, incredibly grounded in their emotions and how they process the world around them,” said Blue May, a producer who worked on “Skin” and believes Crookes has the potential to be “a voice for her generation.” The process of writing “Skin” excavated powerful feelings about her family’s history. Crookes’s Irish father and Bangladeshi mother split, turbulently, when she was two. Navigating their different cultures, she felt she couldn’t “be a byproduct of one or the other” given “how much war that would have caused,” she said. Some traumas left even deeper generational wounds. “All the men in my family were killed in front of my great-grandmother,” Crookes said, referring to Bangladesh’s bloody fight for independence from what was then West Pakistan. “The ramifications of that war live on today.” On the album, Crookes leans into her Bangladeshi roots, singing the colloquial Bangla phrase “Theek Ache” — translated as “it’s OK” — to brush off nightly escapades of drinking and hookups. She also carefully probes her family’s experiences as immigrants living in London. “I’ve seen the things you’ve seen/you don’t speak, you leave the traces,” she sings to her Bangladeshi relatives on the dramatic, soulful “19th floor,” named for her grandmother’s apartment in public housing building in south London, where Crookes spent much of her childhood. In her music videos, Crookes also immortalizes her family’s history. The clip for “Since I Left You” is based on a photograph taken in her family’s village in Bangladesh, and features the musician singing tearfully in front of a corrugated metal shelter with clotheslines blowing in the breeze. For the cinematographer Deepa Keshvala, working with Crookes on the video was the first time in her then seven years in the music industry she had seen someone proudly putting their South Asian heritage on display. “She was 19 when we did that,” she said in a phone interview. At that age, “to have a strong sense of who you are is pretty amazing.” Crookes said her music is therapy that keeps paying dividends. “It’s the way that I let things out, and it just so happens to be my job,” she said. “I think it’s a building block into me as a human being, and learning about myself.” Advertisement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/07/sports/soccer/usmnt-jamaica-world-cup.html,Will British-Born Players Help Jamaica Achieve Soccer Greatness? - The New York Times,"Oct. 7, 2021","Advertisement Supported by ON Soccer Jamaica recruited a crop of British-based players to bolster its World Cup qualifying campaign. The question now: Can it quickly mold them into a team? By Rory Smith LONDON — Sometimes, the best explanation is the simplest one. Last month, in the aftermath of Jamaica’s heavy home defeat to Panama — a result that left the Caribbean country winless and, at that stage, pointless in World Cup qualifying — the finger of blame shifted quickly from the team’s coach, Theodore Whitmore, to his boss, Michael Ricketts. As president of the Jamaican Football Federation, Ricketts had spent much of the previous year trying to overhaul Whitmore’s squad in a bid to supercharge Jamaica’s attempts to reach its first World Cup in a quarter century. In March, he revealed a long list of British-born players of Jamaican heritage who, he said, were in the process of switching their international allegiance to the country of their parents’ or grandparents’ birth, immediately — in theory — boosting Jamaica’s chances of making it through the arduous slog of qualification. His targets were ambitious. The most eye-catching name was Michail Antonio, the West Ham forward who had, relatively late in his career, emerged as one of the most effective strikers in the Premier League. But beyond him lay a slew of equally familiar faces. Southampton’s Nathan Redmond, the Everton teammates Mason Holgate and Demarai Gray and Newcastle’s Isaac Hayden were all applying for Jamaican passports, Ricketts said. So too were Ethan Pinnock and Ivan Toney, of Brentford, and Max Aarons of Norwich City, some of the brightest talents in the second-tier Championship, and Kemar Roofe, a forward for the Scottish champion, Rangers. By the time the Panama game arrived, a host of the recruits who had accepted Ricketts’s overtures were in the team. Pinnock and Liam Moore started in central defense. Roofe and Daniel Johnson, of Preston, played in midfield. Antonio made his debut up front, alongside Bobby Decordova-Reid of Fulham. It did not end well. A few days earlier, without the vast majority of his reinforcements, Whitmore’s team had come within a few minutes of claiming a commendable point on the road in Mexico. Against Panama, though, Jamaica collapsed to a 3-0 defeat. From the outside, the suspicion was that Ricketts was at fault. It was suggested on television that he had destabilized the team by instructing Whitmore to make room for the new arrivals. “I must dispel that totally,” Ricketts said at the time. He called it “absolute rubbish,” and insisted that Whitmore would back him up. “All the J.F.F. did was make contact with the players, and provide the opportunity for the players to represent the country,” he said. Roofe, for one, has spent some time ruminating on that defeat. “It left a sour taste in the mouth,” he said. His conclusion, though, was not quite as intriguing as a dark conspiracy about outside interference. The problem, in his mind, was time. Or, rather, the lack of it. Along with the vast majority of the new additions to Jamaica’s squad, Roofe had been prevented from joining his teammates in Mexico. The country was at the time on the British government’s coronavirus so-called red list, meaning anyone who traveled there would have to spend 10 days in quarantine on their return to Britain. To circumvent that, it was decided that most of the British-based players would skip the game and head instead to Jamaica. As Whitmore and his squad were preparing to face Mexico, Roofe and a half dozen others were being greeted by representatives of the J.F.F. in Kingston and undergoing their mandatory Covid tests. “It was a strange experience,” Roofe said. “The actual squad was in Mexico, so the rest of us flew to Jamaica, met the staff, got a couple of training sessions under our belts. It was good to meet the other players, but it meant when the rest of the team came back, it was a bit rushed.” Roofe and the others introduced themselves, had a single training session — focusing, he said, on “a bit of shape and set pieces” — and then, the next day, went out to play Jamaica’s first home game on a road that, the country hopes, will end in Qatar late next year. “That is the hardest thing in football, having to adapt quickly,” Roofe said. “You’re playing in a team you don’t know, in a style you don’t know, with a manager and players you haven’t met before, and you have to hit the ground running. You can get lucky, and everything just click, but normally it takes a few games.” Ideally, the first of those would have come almost immediately after the Panama defeat, but Roofe and the rest of the squad’s British-based contingent did not have chance: Costa Rica, Jamaica’s next opponent, was also on the red list. Only one player contracted to an English team, in fact — Anthony Grant, of third-tier Swindon Town — started in San José, where Jamaica earned a 1-1 draw. Grant’s case is a little different from many of his new teammates. “I’ve been waiting for the call for years,” he said. “I’d always wanted to play for Jamaica. My grandmother came from there, and went back when she retired. I go every year. I just didn’t really know how you went about it.” Now 34, after more than a decade establishing himself as a steady but unspectacular presence in England’s lower tiers, he had become a little fatalistic about his international hopes. “I’ve had a good career,” he said. “If this came along, I just saw it as a bonus.” He was not mentioned as a potential recruit by Ricketts, but earlier this year he received a message from the J.F.F. through Twitter. His first call-up was the Mexico game. He missed the humiliation against Panama, but impressed against Costa Rica. The divergence in those results has made Jamaica — which left Thursday’s 2-0 defeat to the United States at the bottom of the region’s eight-team table — difficult to assess. There have, so far, been two Jamaicas: the team bolstered by high-profile players from Europe, which as of Thursday had lost its only game to date, and the one without reinforcements, which emerged from its two engagements with a single point but an abundance of credit. How Jamaica’s qualifying campaign unfurls from here — and how much of a challenge it poses to its forthcoming opponents, the United States and Canada — will depend on how easy it is to forge a coherent whole from those twin strands. That challenge has been made more complex by the absence of several of Jamaica’s recently-minted internationals from this week’s fixtures: Pinnock, Moore and Daniel Johnson are all missing through injury, as is Leon Bailey, the Aston Villa forward. Grant will sit out the game against the U.S. because of an issue with his visa. And, most notably, Antonio decided against traveling for this round of games after consulting with his club, West Ham. “It’s tricky if you are not getting a clean run at it,” Roofe said. “You might only need one training session to feel like you belong, but it takes longer to jell fully as a team, to know the intricacies of the players you are playing with.” There is only one way to solve that particular issue, of course, the same problem that Roofe identified at the root of the defeat to Panama: time.  Both Grant and Roofe said they were confident that the Jamaica team that undertakes these three games will be more cogent than the one that played the previous three. And both feel that the longer World Cup qualifying runs, the more dangerous Jamaica will be. The question, of course, is whether there is enough time to make that count.

47,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/sports/sailing/sailgp-catamarans-speed.html,The Blistering Speed of SailGP - The New York Times,"Oct. 8, 2021Updated 8:13 p.m. ET","Advertisement Supported by The catamarans use wings, not sails, and hydrofoils help the boat fly over the water. It’s like a fast video game, with consequences. By Kimball Livingston A generation ago, sailing would not, could not have made the short list of team sports played at highway speeds. The boats that most people race are considered fast at nine knots; screaming at 15. That’s about 10 to 17 m.p.h. Then came the F50 catamaran in 2019, with wings instead of sails and hydrofoils that lift the boats above the friction of the water, reaching speeds beyond 60 m.p.h., as they seemingly fly above the ocean. Indeed, the crew member helping make that happen is called the flight controller, who manipulates the elevations and angles of the left and right hydrofoils centered between bow and stern. In SailGP lingo, the controller can fly the boat higher or lower. Higher is faster, but riskier because it also gets the boat closer to a nosedive. The boats also require a new breed of helmsmen — they call themselves drivers — who direct the rapid-fire team choreography in which decisions must be made in fractions of a second. The wing trimmer, a term from sail trimming days, shapes the wing — an airfoil — for speed and stability. Compared with fabric sails, a wing can provide more stability even while producing more speed. SailGP wings are built from carbon fiber with titanium fittings under a light plastic wrap. The old days of eyeballing sail shape are gone from these boats. Data from racing and practicing is accumulated and analyzed to determine optimum wing shape for speed in different conditions, and the trimmer uses hydraulic controls to achieve the target settings. With more moving parts than an airplane wing, an F50 wing has a larger menu of shape settings. Given more wind, a sailboat tips over farther and farther until it spills wind out of the sails or loses control. Up to a point, SailGP catamarans just keep going faster. The British team hit a record 53.05 knots. or 61.05 m.p.h., during practice last summer. “Compared to traditional boats, what is striking in SailGP is the complexity of the control systems,” said Nathan Outteridge, a two-time Olympic medalist who drives for the Japanese team. “I should say that driving is pretty easy, until things go wrong.” Jason Waterhouse, an Olympic medalist who is flight controller for the Australian team, manages the hydrofoils that go up and down at precise angles with precise timing. Get it wrong, and the boat can nosedive. “I have to have muscle memory,” Waterhouse said about operating the buttons and dials. It’s like a fast video game, with consequences. Waterhouse also controls the rake, or angle, on the horizontal flaps on the two rudders the driver uses to steer. The flight controller contributes to level flight by dialing in as much as seven degrees of differential rake between the rudder flaps. The flap on the side being pushed down by the wind is angled to push up, and the flap on the opposite side is angled to push down. “It adds an extra 300-400 kilos [650 to 900 pounds] of righting moment,” Waterhouse said, referring to the forces working to keep the boat from tipping over. Paul Campbell-James, the wing trimmer for the U.S. team, said that because much of the boat’s hydraulic power was generated by a battery instead of by a crew member turning a grinding pedestal, his team had given that grinder a second job. “We set up our forward-facing grinder to also be a tactician,” Campbell-James said. The grinder spins the pedestal’s handles to generate power for the hydraulics but also looks for wind shifts. Wing shape on these boats has taken over most of the trim-in, trim-out of normal sail control, while contributing to level flight. The key is negative camber, shaping the upper wing to pull opposite to the lower wing, countering the forces trying to tip the boat over. Negative camber adds to the effect of the rudder flaps to make for level sailing. Old school it is not. In turning maneuvers, the crew switches sides and Campbell-James crosses the boat first to take over driving duties before others follow him across. As they come, if he wobbles the helm, the motion could flick his teammates off the deck. At the same time, he has to keep the boat level in a dynamic turn, press a foot button to raise a hydrofoil, respond as the wing loads up on the new side and hang on against “G-forces that are unbelievable because, remember, you might be going 50 knots. That’s a lot going on.” Advertisement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

                   In an ode to her Black, Mexican and Haitian backgrounds, the chef Rahanna Bisseret Martinez created this recipe, which honors one of the Americas’s most important ingredients: corn. Corn grits cooked with unsweetened oat-milk cream act as a base for tender swiss chard leaves, pickled chard stems and mushrooms. Soaked then caramelized in a jalapeño sauce, the mushrooms create layers of varying textures along with the greens. This dish can be served on its own as a hearty one-plate vegan meal, or alongside a main dish or with a crisp and lightly dressed green salad. —Korsha Wilson Recipe adapted from Rahanna Bisseret Martinez in ""Black Food,"" by Bryant Terry (4 Color Books, 2021) Melissa Clark 15 minutes Mark Bittman 40 minutes Martha Rose Shulman 1 hour 15 minutes Martha Rose Shulman 45 minutes Elaine Louie, DBGB Kitchen & Bar 1 hour 45 minutes Melissa Clark, Jessica Koslow 1 hour Martha Rose Shulman 1 hour Tejal Rao, Kristin Donnelly 1 1/2 hours Robert Farrar Capon 10 minutes Florence Fabricant 30 minutes Moira Hodgson 1 hour Florence Fabricant 1 hour 15 minutes Florence Fabricant 1 hour Florence Fabricant 1 hour 15 minutes Barbara Kafka 2 hours 15 minutes Elaine Louie, Raffaele Ronca 1 hour and 15 minutes Genevieve Ko 10 minutes Naz Deravian 30 minutes Hetty Mckinnon 30 minutes Ali Slagle 15 minutes Hetty Mckinnon 20 minutes Dorie Greenspan 1 hour 10 minutes Rebekah Peppler David Tanis 1 hour, plus steeping Rebekah Peppler David Tanis 1 1/2 hours David Tanis 20 minutes Yasmin Fahr 25 minutes Nargisse Benkabbou 1 hour, plus cooling Korsha Wilson, Bryant Terry, Alexander Smalls 25 minutes Korsha Wilson, Bryant Terry 10 minutes, plus refrigeration Lara Lee 45 minutes Cooking Guide

                   The tangy, rich cream cheese topping on this cake can travel — even on a hot day. Silky with sour cream, it bakes right over the batter and develops a caramelized flavor reminiscent of Basque cheesecake. As it cools, the deeply browned surface ripples, and the custardy cream cheese layer sets. The carrot cake beneath packs more carrots than most classic versions for a more complex natural sweetness and fine, sturdy crumb. Both batters are mixed by hand in the same bowl, making prep and clean up especially easy.

                   The equal proportions of vermouth and cider make this cocktail especially easy to pour or batch up. Choose a cider with a bit of tartness and funk, and reach for a quality red vermouth. Sweet and slightly viscous, it stands up to and smooths out the cider’s personality. Finally, don’t skimp on the garnish. The orange, olives and peppers should be deployed in a way that feels less like decoration and more like a snack. Drop the skewer straight into your cocktail to impart notes of citrus and brine — or lay it on top to snack on and sip at your leisure.

                   You can make personal pizzas quickly by using premade naan, flatbread or pita as the base, then topping with whatever sounds good to you. Here, the combination of feta, Parmesan, ricotta and mozzarella hits every note — salty, creamy, tangy and gooey. Corn’s sweetness balances the savoriness, and a generous amount of black pepper cuts through the richness, as it does in cacio e pepe. Feel free to swap the cheeses based on what you have — pecorino instead of Parmesan, fontina instead of mozzarella — and incorporate any toppings you like: spinach, herbs, garlic, red-pepper flakes, hot honey and so on.

55,https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-hair-dryer/,The 4 Best Hair Dryers 2021 | Reviews by Wirecutter,FYI,"Wirecutter is reader-supported. When you buy through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more FYI  We tested 16 additional hair dryers, and although we’re still confident in our picks, we’ve discovered a few other good hair dryers. We tested 16 additional hair dryers, and although we’re still confident in our picks, we’ve discovered a few other good hair dryers. Rusk is discontinuing the CTC Lite dryer we used to recommend as a runner-up. We plan to test its suggested replacement, the Rusk Pro Speed Titanium, as well as the Shark HyperAir.  October 7, 2021 Most hair dryers are effective at blowing hot air toward your head—sometimes quite fast—in order to speed along your hair styling from showering to whatever’s next. It’s the small differences between models that can make a big difference overall, particularly with daily use. After putting in 20 hours of research and spending nearly 50 hours testing 39 dryers, we’ve found that some dryers are far more pleasant to hold and use than others. Because it provides an excellent experience for the price, we think the Rusk W8less Professional 2000 Watt Dryer is the best choice. We looked only at dryers with multiple heat settings. We also preferred a cool-shot option. A too-short cord renders even the most effective hair dryer useless in certain situations. Lighter-weight dryers (around a pound) are easier and more enjoyable to use for long periods of time. Our favorite hair dryer is lightweight and equipped with a long cord, and among the models we tested, it tied for blowing the hottest and fastest air. We like it just as much as dryers several times the price. *At the time of publishing, the price was $110. Speed and heat are the only features that matter for drying your hair efficiently, and with a 55 mph airflow that exceeds 245 degrees Fahrenheit, the Rusk W8less Professional 2000 Watt Dryer is one of the fastest and hottest dryers we tested. It weighs less than a pound, it has an 8-foot cord (one of the longest we found), it’s notably comfortable to hold, and overall it has the best combination of features we deem important—and that’s the case by far, even when you compare it with dryers that cost hundreds of dollars. The Rusk W8less comes with a concentrator, which is helpful for straightening hair. It does not come with a diffuser, however; if you use one for curly hair, consider our budget pick, which is faster but heavier and doesn’t get nearly as hot as the W8less. Advertisement Although this dryer is just as fast as pricier models, it’s one of the heaviest we tested, and its attachments can be hard to remove. If you don’t care about weight, consider the InfinitiPro by Conair 1875-Watt Salon Performance AC Motor Styling Tool. Commonly found in drugstores, this dryer produces airflow that’s faster (65 mph) than that of our top pick and almost as hot (205 °F). At 1.3 pounds, however, it may feel heavy after you spend a couple of minutes holding it above your head. The 6-foot cord, though shorter than those on our other picks, is longer than those on most other inexpensive hair dryers. The buttons are easy to use, but the cool-shot button is a little small and harder to hold down than the cool-shot button on our top pick. The InfinitiPro comes with both a diffuser and a concentrator. It’s expensive, but the unique design makes it extraordinarily nice to use: There’s no vibration whatsoever, and the simple-to-switch magnetic attachments make styling easier. If you are willing to splurge on a dryer, you might consider the Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer. It has consistently been our favorite to use since we first tested it in 2016. With airflow at 88 mph and a temperature surpassing 245 °F (the hottest temperature our weather meter could measure), the Supersonic doesn’t dry hair any faster than our pick, but it is more pleasant to use in almost every way due to its unique design. The motor sits in the handle, making the nozzle shorter and easier to maneuver. The handle doesn’t vibrate at all, which wasn’t true of other “luxury” models we tested. It has a long, 9-foot cord, and it’s less grating noise-wise than other dryers. It also comes with two magnetically attaching concentrators and a diffuser, all of which are exceptionally easy to add or remove mid-blowout. It’s pricey, it’s bulky, and it works—quickly and gently. For hair that’s fragile or difficult to blow-dry with a conventional hair dryer, the RevAir is worth considering. Another spendy dryer, the RevAir, is unlike any other hair-drying, heat-styling tool we’ve tested. For people with Type 3 or 4 curl patterns especially, this vacuum-like device is gentle on fragile strands and can cut down total drying time significantly. One tester, who usually requires two back-to-back appointments with a professional stylist at Drybar, now achieves similar drying and smoothing results with the RevAir in as little as 20 minutes. The entire corded machine has an exceptionally large footprint compared with most other dryers: It weighs about 10 pounds in total and is the size of a small microwave. The hose-attached handheld wand alone weighs more than our heavier dryer picks (around 2 pounds), but we found that this is not terribly problematic because very little motion is required to use it.  Our favorite hair dryer is lightweight and equipped with a long cord, and among the models we tested, it tied for blowing the hottest and fastest air. We like it just as much as dryers several times the price. *At the time of publishing, the price was $110.

It’s pricey, it’s bulky, and it works—quickly and gently. For hair that’s fragile or difficult to blow-dry with a conventional hair dryer, the RevAir is worth considering. We interviewed two dermatologists to learn how heat styling affects hair: Melissa Piliang, who specializes in hair disorders at the Cleveland Clinic, and Rebecca Kazin, an assistant professor of dermatology at Johns Hopkins. We also spoke to Allen Ruiz, Aveda’s global director of hair styling; Perry Romanowski, a cosmetic chemist; and Jim Shapiro, an electrical engineer. We spoke to a second engineer at a large research university just long enough to get his informed opinion that there’s no obvious mechanism for a lot of the claims that hair dryer manufacturers make. In addition, we consulted hair-dryer-related patents. If you can’t leave the house with wet hair for aesthetic reasons or because it’s below freezing outside and you don’t want your head to be covered in icicles, you need a hair dryer. You also need one if you plan on using other hot tools on your hair: Make sure you’re really getting your hair dry if you’re going to take a flat iron to it (smushing hair between two hot pieces of metal is really bad for it if it’s still wet, according to our dermatologist sources). But even if you normally let your hair air-dry, blow-drying it could help protect it from breakage. Despite what magazine lists and advertisements would have you believe (hair dryers for coarse hair! hair dryers for thin hair! hair dryers for dry hair!), hair dryers are one-size-fits-all. No dryer will make your hair more marvelously voluminous and glossy than another. What your hair looks like comes down to technique, products, and, in large part, its natural characteristics. The packaging for hair dryers is adorned with a ton of buzzwords and specs. Most of these “features” are useless at best and pseudoscience at worst. There are no clinical studies examining whether one type of hair dryer is better for your hair than another—at least, none that we, nor the dermatologists we interviewed, could find. For all the words and phrases associated with hair dryers—“tourmaline,” “ionic,” “ceramic,” “conditioning nano beads”—hairstylist Allen Ruiz told us he looks for two qualities in the appliance: “hot and fast.” (And that said, in our testing, differences in heat and speed from dryer to dryer often failed to noticeably affect the dry time.) The hotness and fastness of a hair dryer are connected to the wattage, but they’re not perfectly correlated: A very high-wattage dryer can produce more heat than a lower-wattage one, but that doesn’t mean it will. Most hair dryers (including most of our picks) are about 1,875 watts anyway. And according to engineer Jim Shapiro, “Essentially all of the energy used by each dryer will be converted into heat, so don’t expect or look for much difference among the dryers here.” For all the buzzwords and superlatives you can find on the side of hair dryer boxes, the key specs don’t vary much from model to model. Beyond heat and speed, we considered the following features: Hairstylist Allen Ruiz told us he looks for two qualities in the appliance: “hot and fast.” Objective features aside, the main thing that separated the dryers we loved from those we didn’t was a bit harder to quantify: how they felt in our hands. In addition to weight, that overall feel depends on the following factors: We did not consider folding or other “travel” hair dryers. Instead, we prioritized certain features, including nozzle length and body weight. Travel dryers sacrifice comfort (their handles are typically clunky) and have additional components that can break. Some of the truly compact ones offer a smaller design at the expense of solid wattage, the ability to attach a diffuser, and the inclusion of a cool-shot button. Judging from how budget dryers performed in our tests, we can say that any hotel hair dryer offering over 1,800 watts should give you the same results as a spendier one that you bring from home. Ultimately, because we found so many dryers that fit our criteria during our first round of research, we chose to test an initial group of 15 models that had great reviews from other sources, such as Good Housekeeping (which, unlike most mainstream magazines, has a testing strategy for its recommended dryers), as well as Amazon, Sephora, and drugstore websites. In 2020 and 2021, we added to that original testing pool another 24 highly rated hair dryers. We took basic stats on our dryers, using a weather meter to test the speed and heat and a postage scale to weigh them. We also measured the cord lengths. Often our own readings disagreed with the manufacturer-stated specs. We found that on the top setting, most dryers blew air at about 40 mph as measured a couple of inches away from the nozzle. That blowing air was around 200 °F (more if we held the dryer in place for a few moments). Although some dryers achieved faster wind speeds than others, interestingly that didn’t end up translating to notably or consistently faster dry times once we used them on our hair. All of the dryers took more or less the same amount of time to dry hair. For the initial iteration of this guide, we timed the models drying a swatch of hair from a wig wetted with 5 grams of water, with the dryers on their highest setting. We tested the dryer that had an on/off switch for ions, the Harry Josh model, in both positions. If there were big differences in the quality of the air a dryer gave off, they would show in these tests. Two things became clear after our first round of swatch time tests: First, all of the dryers took more or less the same amount of time to dry hair. Little things, such as how close we held the dryer or how the hair moved around, were what really made the hair dry faster or slower. Second, in this round we also found that many of the dryers had designs that made them annoying to use. (See the Competition section for more details.) With a few dryers eliminated, we put our favorites through some more time tests with the hair swatch and then brought them home for a couple of weeks and used them in our daily routines, timing how long they took to dry hair and feeling for any general differences in the quality of the resulting blowout. We found basically none. Many of the dryers we looked at had marketing copy claiming that they were some percentage faster than the competition and that they would leave hair looking better than the competition—promises often corroborated by Amazon reviews. There could well be a collection of slow dryers out there that make your hair look like crap and that everyone else is comparing these models with, but we didn’t seek them out. Since originally publishing this review, we’ve continued to test our picks over the course of months and years for durability, paying mind to the subtle aspects of user experience that become apparent over long-term use. Our favorite hair dryer is lightweight and equipped with a long cord, and among the models we tested, it tied for blowing the hottest and fastest air. We like it just as much as dryers several times the price. *At the time of publishing, the price was $110. The Rusk W8less Professional 2000 Watt Dryer offers all the features you need in a hair dryer while costing a fraction of the price of a luxury model. The W8less is one of the lightest, fastest, and hottest dryers we’ve tried (1 pound, 55 mph, and over 245 °F, respectively). Those are the only features that matter for drying your hair efficiently. The buttons are all nicely placed—easy to push but hard to press accidentally—and the cord is long enough (8 feet) to reach distant outlets. Unlike on other dryers, the cool-shot button is wide, so holding it down for several seconds isn’t uncomfortable. The housing is nice: It’s glossy white, and the logo is understated. The handle is slightly curved, with a notch at the top. The sound of the air is smooth. The dryer comes with a concentrator, too. Most important, the Rusk W8less takes about the same amount of time to blow-dry hair as dryers that cost hundreds of dollars. It’s capable of making your hair look just as nice as any other dryer. The Rusk W8less comes with a two-year warranty. The Rusk W8less doesn’t come with a diffuser. If you have curly hair and prefer using a diffuser to dry it, you have to buy one separately (though it’s best to buy a hair dryer that comes with one, like our budget pick). We’ve seen the price of this dryer fluctuate a lot on Amazon, which can be frustrating if you’re taking your time to consider a purchase; on the other hand, you could score a surprise deal. Although this dryer is just as fast as pricier models, it’s one of the heaviest we tested, and its attachments can be hard to remove. In our tests, the airflow from the InfinitiPro by Conair 1875-Watt Salon Performance AC Motor Styling Tool was faster than that of our top pick at 65 mph, but at 205 °F it was not as hot as that Rusk model (which reached over 245 °F). This hair dryer is considerably less expensive, too. The main reason it’s not our top pick is its weight: At 1.3 pounds, it’s noticeably heavier to hold than the Rusk, especially after several minutes of drying. Its cord is 6 feet long—not quite as long as that of our top pick, but longer than the cords on other models you can find at a drugstore. The InfinitiPro typically comes with a concentrator and a diffuser (but some colors, such as black, come with only the concentrator). Although these pieces snap onto the nozzle, they look as if they might screw on, which can be confusing at first. Conair covers the InfinitiPro with an impressive four-year warranty (PDF). This dryer is usually available in six color options. It’s expensive, but the unique design makes it extraordinarily nice to use: There’s no vibration whatsoever, and the simple-to-switch magnetic attachments make styling easier. It’s no more effective than our other picks, but if you want the most pleasant hair-drying experience possible, the Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer provides that. This dryer has an unusual design that makes it extraordinarily nice to use. It doesn’t vibrate whatsoever (all other dryers vibrate just a little, and the effect is not especially noticeable until you hold one that doesn’t), and its simple-to-switch magnetic attachments make styling with a diffuser or a concentrator easier. The dryer has a 9-foot cord. The Dyson offers the fastest wind speed of all the dryers we’ve tested (88 mph measured at a distance of 2 inches) and ties our top pick for the hottest air at over 245 °F, the highest temperature our weather meter could measure. However, in our tests the air speed tangled our hair more, and Good Housekeeping found even the lower speed settings to be too strong. (For an additional $40, you can buy Dyson’s Gentle diffuser.) Although other reviewers (video) have found that the Dyson can sometimes dry hair a tad faster than the competition, after we put in a week of careful timed testing on our own hair, we found that this wasn’t consistently true: Drying hair with the Dyson sometimes took a bit longer than with our top pick. The concentrator and diffuser attachments connect to the nozzle magnetically, a nifty feature we haven’t seen on any other dryer. They don’t get burning hot, as they’re made of two layers of plastic with a gap of air between them, so you can rotate or remove them mid-session, unlike on other dryers, where you must handle attachments carefully or angle the dryer awkwardly to switch them. Although the Dyson dryer’s feel and attachments are improvements over those of our other picks, we also found features we didn’t like and a few that we were neutral on. The position of the speed and heat buttons on the back of the dryer’s head makes them hard to reach, and the cool-shot button is in an awkward spot at the very top of the handle. If you don’t change speeds and temperature a lot, though, the button locations might be a bonus, as they are hard to hit accidentally. Meanwhile, the cord has a small power bar near the plug, which itself is bulky. The motor sits in the handle of the dryer, rather than in the head, and the handle is straight and a tad thicker than that of the Rusk. Dyson says the motor placement makes the weight of the dryer more balanced, since it’s not top-heavy. The difference isn’t huge, but over weeks of using the Dyson dryer, we found ourselves appreciating the configuration. If you have trouble gripping a typical dryer, the weight distribution of this one might make gripping easier, a reader told us. The motor sucks air through a fine mesh from the bottom of the handle rather than through a grill at the back of the dryer, and the company claims it’s difficult for long hair to get stuck in the filter as a result. (Much of Dyson’s $71 million research and design tab for the dryer went into the motor, which is a smaller version of the motor found in Dyson’s handheld vacuum cleaners.) At 1 pound, the Dyson Supersonic is the same weight as our top pick, the Rusk W8less. One tester found that the heavier cord tired out her arms when she was drying the top of her head, though resting the power bar (which most dryers do not have) on the counter helped. The sound the Dyson emits is a high-pitched whine with none of the low rattle that other dryers put out. Whether this sound is more pleasant, as the company claims, is a matter of personal opinion, though. As with any dryer, the sound of whooshing air is physically impossible to eliminate. Despite the Dyson’s flaws, one tester found herself reaching for it consistently over our other picks in 2016, when she initially tested it, and again in 2018, when she did a second round of testing. Overall, compared with other dryers we’ve tested, this one truly feels like a luxury to use every day. If you decide that the Dyson dryer might be worth $400 to you, we recommend purchasing it from Sephora, which has a generous return policy. Dyson also sells refurbished versions of this hair dryer at reduced prices on eBay. These units carry a one-year warranty but are non-returnable. Just remember, this model can’t make your hair look any different than other dryers can. Some reviewers claim that it does (as is common with luxury dryers), perhaps in part because the company likes to show off its tools to journalists with the help of professionals.  The Supersonic has a two-year warranty and comes in four color combinations. It’s pricey, it’s bulky, and it works—quickly and gently. For hair that’s fragile or difficult to blow-dry with a conventional hair dryer, the RevAir is worth considering. If you have hair that is damage-prone or very curly, or if it takes forever to blow-dry, the benefits of the RevAir might be worth its extra expense (for additional details, read our full RevAir review). This unconventional hair-drying vacuum is expensive, bulky, and loud, but it’s extremely effective, providing a particularly gentle, expedient way to dry your hair. It relies on “reverse air” suction to simultaneously dry, stretch, straighten, and smooth hair. The RevAir is a different animal from the other, more conventional hair dryers we recommend, so comparing specs such as wind speed doesn’t make sense. But anecdotally, we found that this unique appliance consistently dried and straightened our tester’s curly hair much faster than any traditional dryer, with minimal tangling and hair shedding. Other reviewers’ reactions to the RevAir vary by hair type: For those with finer, less curly hair, it tends to be an appealing novelty (video) not necessarily worth shelling out for, while those with Type 3 or 4 curl patterns tend to find it revolutionary and worth the splurge (video). It has a 7-foot hose that attaches to a 9-inch heat-producing wand. At 2 pounds, the wand alone is heavier than any of our dryer picks. Rather than raising the dryer to your hair, however, you insert sections of your hair into the wand; the device then quickly and gently sucks the damp hair dry. It offers seven suction power levels and three heat settings (high, low, or the no-heat cool shot). The RevAir has no purpose other than hair drying and straightening; it doesn’t accommodate (or need) attachments such as a diffuser or concentrator. It’s also huge. Unlike our other picks, it doesn’t easily fit in bathroom cabinets or on a countertop: Altogether it weighs 10 pounds and is the size of a small microwave. The RevAir comes with a one-year warranty, half the coverage period of the Rusk W8less and the Dyson Supersonic. A common feature that hair dryer makers tout is the ability to make hair shinier. When we asked hairstylist Allen Ruiz about the best way to get shiny hair, he said: “Use a product that leaves the hair shiny and smooth.” Which is to say, shiny hair doesn’t really have anything to do with the dryer. Cosmetic chemist Perry Romanowski told us that the only things a blow dryer could do that styling products couldn’t were to “dry the hair more uniformly and keep hair straight.” Straight hair can be shinier hair: On straight hair, the cuticle—the outer, scaly layer of a strand of hair—lies flatter, reflecting light. But even if your goal is to have shiny, straight hair, the only dryer qualities that can help you achieve that more effectively are good old “hot and fast.” You’ll see plenty of features—ceramic coils, an ion generator, tourmaline—noted in marketing materials and pretty much every other dryer buying guide. But those are features of nearly all dryers. We visited the hair dryer section of Sephora twice while writing this guide and failed to extract any logical reason from the salespeople as to why their curated selection of designer dryers were better than other options.  Ions are technically able to reduce frizz—but only frizz from static. Wet hair cannot hold a charge. One thing that you should definitely avoid are retail employees who tell you that a $200 dryer is special “because it has ions.” Mainstream magazines and hair dryer packaging commonly promote ions as a feature that makes hair less frizzy and more shiny. Hair dryers do produce ions, which are just particles (of air, in this case) that are charged (negatively, in this case). We found a report in which a high school physics teacher put an ionic dryer in front of a device that measures ions, and lo, it found something to measure. But because almost all hair dryers are “ionic,” it’s hardly a thing worth debating, except for academic clarity. Our tests (below) didn’t show any meaningful difference with ionic settings on or off. Engineer Jim Shapiro’s opinion: “Ions? Please.” Ions are technically able to reduce frizz—but only frizz from static. If you brush your hair while blow-drying it—or you just exist, in the winter months, depending on your hair—positive charge can build up, causing strands to repel away from your head and stick out. But wet hair cannot hold a charge. A blast of negative ions from a hair dryer on dry hair would bring it back to a neutral charge, but if you have a huge static issue, you can also just use a smoothing cream (which is easier to fit in a bag anyway) or a tiny bit of water. Another claim regarding ions is that they can break up water molecules and speed up drying time. We couldn’t find any reason this would be the case, and neither could the engineers we spoke to. Doctor and prominent skeptic Ben Goldacre has questioned the ions-make-water-droplets-smaller phenomenon, too, on his blog Bad Science. Still, for good measure, we planned to test an ion-button-equipped dryer with and without ions in effect, just to see for ourselves if we were missing something. Finally, sometimes makers of hair dryers with an on/off ion button claim that the feature is there so that you can use the dryer with the ion button set to “off” for fine hair to make it more voluminous. This could possibly work only if you were going for the kind of volume produced by static electricity. As for other features, the dermatologists we interviewed recommended ceramic-coated coils. They provide “a more even heat” than other materials, according to Melissa Piliang. All hair dryers work by heating up an element, such as a metal coil, and then blowing air over it, carrying the heat to your head. Ceramic material does heat up faster and radiate heat more evenly than iron or nickel. (Many space heaters also employ ceramic elements.) But the engineers we spoke to were skeptical that this component makes much of a difference in drying hair: Radiant heat isn’t really helpful “unless you expect to direct the heat far from the dryer,” said Shapiro, such as if you were trying to use a dryer to heat a room for some reason. Any heating element in a dryer gets the heat to your head via the blowing air. And though ceramic material does heat evenly, we couldn’t feel a difference in the heat coming from the dryers we tested with ceramic coils versus those made with other materials. Regardless, you should move your dryer around as you do your hair, so the exact evenness of the heat coming from the dryer doesn’t matter too much. The bottom line is that most hair dryers have ceramic-coated elements anyway; don’t let a box’s claims fool you into thinking you’re getting something special. Another material commonly found inside hair dryers is the mineral tourmaline, which is supposed to help reduce frizz. Even a piddly little wall-mounted hair dryer in a hotel one tester stayed at while writing this guide claimed to have it. The mineral is very pretty, but as Shapiro said: “Tourmaline? Please, squared.” It’s impossible to see the tourmaline because it’s ground up and in the barrel of the dryer, and it doesn’t have to be present in large amounts to be advertised on the box: Patents for gemstone dryers that we read involve a slew of minerals that manufacturers use to coat the inside of the dryer. Rebecca Kazin told us that she looked for tourmaline in a hair dryer but that there were no clinical studies on its being better for hair. Her exact words were: “I believe in tourmaline.” We read—in a patent—that heated tourmaline can emit electromagnetic radiation that can alter the structure of your hair. The person who holds that patent also has one for a device that diagnoses “body deficiencies” (the patent is not specific, but it does say you treat them with drugs) by measuring a person’s electromagnetic field. (Patents can give you a great idea of how something is supposed to work but are not necessarily fact-checked for scientific accuracy.) You can ignore claims about “conditioning nano beads” or “silk proteins” that are, supposedly, infused in the heating elements and barrels of some dryers. “That is just marketing hype,” Romanowski said. To our surprise, we found that blow-drying might be better for hair than air-drying, for a couple of reasons. Extended contact with water causes the stuff in between a hair’s cuticles, called the cell membrane complex, to swell and bulge, weakening the hair slightly. As a result, putting your hair up in a ponytail when it’s wet can cause breakage, as dermatologist Rebecca Kazin pointed out, because the strands are weighed down with water. One small study found that blow-drying while holding the dryer 6 inches away from your head actually causes less overall damage than air-drying. Using a hair dryer still causes more damage to the outer layer of hair, but if breakage is a problem for you, blow-drying your hair on a low setting could be helpful. Dermatologist Melissa Piliang advised that “it’s best to embrace your natural texture” and not fight it when you are choosing how to dry your hair, because doing so can make it frizzier over the long run. Ads for hair products and articles in mainstream magazines like to equate healthy hair with smooth and shiny hair. But shininess isn’t the same as health—we checked with dermatologists. One small study found that blow-drying while holding the dryer 6 inches away from your head actually causes less overall damage than air-drying. All hair dryers cause some damage. Hair cuticles are “kind of like shingles on a roof,” Piliang explained. Heat causes them to dry out and peel up, which can let in moisture and increase frizz. Some hair is just naturally more dry to begin with, which means it starts out more prone to frizz. To minimize damage, Piliang advises decreasing the overall time you have to spend pointing hot air at your hair by towel-drying it first. Then, blow-dry it in sections. Clip some of your hair up in a half ponytail, dry what’s underneath, and then undo the ponytail so you’re not just subjecting the same dry strands to direct heat. While you’re drying, hold the blow dryer so that it shoots air downward, with the grain of the hair cuticle, rather than against it. Although no conventional dryer we’ve tested has proven notably faster than another, following this method (versus drying hair without pinning it up and going in sections) reliably saves us a couple of minutes in drying our hair. Don’t keep blasting your hair with the highest heat setting, Piliang said. When your hair is almost dry, turn the dryer to a lower setting. (Cooler air takes a little longer to finish drying hair; personally, we’re too impatient for this.) Also, don’t use a metal round brush to style your hair, she told us; it just transfers heat directly to your hair, which is bad for the cuticles. Use a plastic brush and “keep things moving,” she said, so you’re not blasting any one spot with heat for too long. If you have curly hair, don’t brush it as you are drying it, as that will just ruffle the cuticle (unless you are trying to straighten it). A diffuser will help you work with your natural hair shape, an approach that is less damaging to your hair than trying to make it do something it doesn’t naturally do. Most, but not all, blow dryers are at least compatible with a diffuser, and you can buy one easily if one doesn’t come with the dryer. “I prefer a diffuser with ‘fingers’ in it for creating really defined curl,” hairstylist Allen Ruiz told us. “You want to work section by section and make sure to tilt and lean your head as you go, gently [putting each] section of curls into the diffuser.” (Here’s a video that shows what he means.) The PR team behind the Harry Josh Pro Tools Pro Dryer 2000 seems successful: The dryer appears three times in this list of items that beauty editors “swear by.” The team has also done a great job of placing targeted ads all over social media. One infomercial the ads link to features celebrity hairstylist Harry Josh himself discussing people whose hair he has styled for magazines. Covers flash on the screen: Amanda Seyfried, Katy Perry, Tina Fey.

PR shots of Harry Josh products, and supermodel Karlie Kloss kissing Josh on the cheek. There are things about this dryer that are genuinely nice. It has a short nozzle, which would make it slightly easier to fit in a suitcase for travel,NA, this is what you’re paying for. In our tests, the cool-shot button was easy to push, and all the buttons were placed nicely on the back of the dryer—no poking, no accidental pushing. Hype aside, this dryer has only one major design drawback: On our scale, the Harry Josh dryer, at 1.21 pounds, was on the heavier side of the models we tested. But the real issue with the Harry Josh dryer is that, in our testing, it didn’t deliver the superior hair experience it claims to. In addition to promoting the usual erroneous facts about ions that get stamped on hair dryers, Josh has said that this model blows air at 81 mph. We’re not sure how he got that number, because our weather meter said 40 mph. It’s possible that the Harry Josh dryer will last longer than other dryers, though the warranty covers two years, the same length as the coverage on our top pick. The Dyson Airwrap is a multipurpose styling tool with a number of attachments that can curl, straighten (with a brush), or blow-dry hair (with an add-on that looks like a thinner, oval version of the Supersonic head). We haven’t taken a wind meter to it, but the company says the dryer-attachment-equipped Airwrap is not as powerful as the Supersonic and is meant to get hair a bit dry before you use the other attachments, which, unlike most other curlers and straighteners, can work on damp hair. It also isn’t compatible with a diffuser or concentrator. Three testers with different hair types and textures had polarized opinions on the $550 Airwrap, especially when comparing their brush-attachment blowout results with those they achieved with the $60 Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer and Volumizer, a revered hot-air brush that’s a best seller on Amazon. Neither the Airwrap nor the One-Step Hair Dryer and Volumizer is a standard hair dryer, so we didn’t compare them against our picks for this guide. We did attempt to test the styling tools against one another, but we found that comparison, well, hairy. Hair dryer brushes like the Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer and Volumizer circulate heated air from within, through holes between the bristles. They are designed to replace the pairing of a traditional hair dryer with a separate brush. Most hair dryer brushes are cylindrical in shape and have 360 degrees of bristles, as round styling brushes do. However, some people find paddle-style hair dryer brushes gentler and better for detangling than cylindrical models, since this brush style may reduce snagging. Because the bristles and airflow are restricted to one side of a paddle-style hair dryer brush, you have more control over the amount of heat you apply to your hair. This control comes at a cost, though: Paddle-style hair dryer brushes are notorious for being unable to reach hair roots, and it often takes longer to dry a full head of hair with one than it does with either a round hair dryer brush or a traditional hair dryer. However, paddle-style hair dryer brushes do a decent job of drying and straightening hair, especially when you’re preparing hair for a second round of styling (with a curling iron, straightening comb, or braids). We tried four paddle-style hair dryer brushes, finding the best overall to be the Conair InfinitiPro Hot Air Paddle Brush. Although we recommend the vacuum-style RevAir dryer for people with more fragile strands, for around a tenth of the price the Conair is a decent and similarly gentle option for hair drying and straightening. Despite having the lowest wattage of any of the paddle hair dryer brushes we considered (600 watts), it dried hair sections almost as quickly as the brush we tried with the highest wattage: the Instagram darling EZ Dryer Ion (1,200 watts). This result may be due to two factors unique to the Conair brush, namely its slimmer oval shape (most paddle brushes are wide and rectangular) and a combination of different bristle materials and lengths, all of which make it much easier to dry hair closer to the scalp. Like all of the paddle-style hair dryer brushes we tested, the Conair has three heat settings (high, low, and cool). At less than 11 ounces, it ties with the EZ Dryer Ion for the lightest of the paddle-style models we tested. The Conair has a 5-foot cord and comes with a two-year warranty. The EZ Dryer Ion is the most effective and efficient paddle-style hair dryer brush we tested. But because it’s missing markings for the air-temperature settings, determining at a glance which setting the brush is on is impossible. More important, it lacks an ALCI (appliance leakage current interrupter) safety plug, so if it shorts or is immersed in water, the device won’t automatically turn off and therefore could cause an electrical shock. It’s covered by an ultrashort (14-day) warranty, too. We also tried the Hot Tools One-Step Detachable Straight Dry Paddle Dryer and the Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer and Styler, both of which were clunkier, heavier, and slower to dry than the Conair. Their designs also made it difficult for us to directly reach hair roots compared with the other paddle-style hair dryer brushes we tested. If you can’t find the Rusk W8less in stock: The BaBylissPro Porcelain Ceramic Carrera2 Dryer is a great substitute. Priced at $100 (though often on sale), it’s not much more expensive than the W8less, but at a pound and a half, it ties with the Conair Pro Yellow Bird for the heaviest dryer we’ve tested. With speeds reaching 60 mph, it’s almost as fast as the W8less (65 mph), and like the W8less it can reach temperatures over 245 °F (the hottest our weather meter could measure). It also has an extra-long cord measuring 9 feet 10 inches—nearly 2 feet longer than the W8less’s cord. Like the W8less, the Carrera2 comes with only a concentrator (not a diffuser) and has two speeds, three temperatures, and a cool shot. If the Conair InfinitiPro 1875-Watt Styling Tool, our budget pick, is unavailable: The Revlon Turbo-Speed Hair Dryer is an inexpensive, extremely lightweight, serviceable hair dryer. Costing $25 (often on sale for $15 or so) and weighing under a pound, it’s one of the least expensive yet one of the lightest dryers we’ve ever tested. It’s also one of the slowest of the dryers we like (41 mph), and it has the shortest usable cord (5 feet 6 inches). However, the Turbo-Speed is one of the hottest dryers we’ve tested, reaching over 245 °F in just a few seconds, blowing the InfinitiPro’s 205 °F out of the water. It has only two speeds (in contrast to the InfinitiPro’s three), and whereas our budget pick comes with both a diffuser and a concentrator, the Turbo-Speed has only a diffuser. This inexpensive Revlon model is polarizing—people either love it or hate it—and a few damning owner reviews claim that it melts, burns hair, and poses a fire hazard. If you have Type 4 (coarse and curly) hair and don’t want to shell out for the RevAir: The retro-looking Conair Pro Yellow Bird Hair Dryer is a cult favorite. It’s one of the hottest dryers we’ve tested (reaching over 245 °F), but at a pound and a half, it also ties for the heaviest dryer we’ve looked at. Its buttons are strangely placed and unlabeled, but it’s the only dryer we like that comes with a straightening pick. It also comes with a diffuser, offers four speeds and temperatures (no cool shot), and has a cord measuring an ample 7 feet 10 inches. We’re evaluating additional hair dryers to see how they compare with our picks. This new group includes the Rusk Pro Speed Titanium Hair Dryer, which the company suggested as a replacement for the outgoing CTC Lite model we previously recommended, and the lightweight Trezoro 9300, an Amazon best seller. We are also testing the Shark HyperAir, which has a variety of attachment options. The gorgeous GHD Helios 1875W Advanced Professional Hair Dryer is heavier and slower than our pick, the Rusk W8less—and three times the price. However, at over 9.5 feet, its cord ties with that of the Amika Accomplice for the second-longest cord of any hair dryer we’ve tested, and this dryer is especially beautiful. In comparison with the Rusk W8less, the Amika Accomplice Compact Dryer is heavier, limited to a lower max temperature (215 °F), and double the price. However, its 9.5-foot cord ties with that of the GHD Helios for the second-longest cord among the dryers we’ve tried. The Conair InfinitiPro SmoothWrap Hair Dryer is slower and has a shorter cord than all of our picks. However, it is lightweight (a pound), and it reaches temperatures above 245 °F. At 1 pound, the BaBylissPro Rapido Dryer is an ultra-lightweight dryer, and it comes with a 9-foot cord, but it’s slower and over double the price of the Rusk W8less. (We’d go with the company’s Carrera2 over this one if we had to choose between the two.) Of the Dyson Supersonic lookalikes, the Karrong F350 seemed the most promising to us, but it ended up being half as fast, with no way to control speed separately from temperature—the hotter it got, the faster it got. Also, there was no warranty information to be found. At an impressive 11 feet long, the CHI Touch 2 Dryer’s cord is the longest of any dryer we’ve tested, but this dryer is more expensive and much slower than the Rusk W8less. It also has a mere one year of warranty coverage, and its non-intuitive touchscreen felt gimmicky. The lightweight and long-corded Hot Tools Professional Black Gold Turbo Ionic Salon Dryer is a little heavier and not as fast as the Rusk W8less, and it’s typically more expensive, too. On top of that, owner reviews allege poor longevity. (This dryer is covered by a whopping seven-year warranty, though.)  The Hot Tools Professional Black Gold Turbo Ionic Salon Dryer (DC Motor) is extremely light at only 14 ounces. But it also has the most buttons and slides and switches of any hair dryer we’ve ever tested, including a cool-shot button, a power-boost slide, an ion select wheel, switches for speed and temp—whew! It’s also one of the slower dryers we’ve tested. The Hot Tools Pro Artist White Gold Digital Salon Dryer, the Panasonic Nanoe EH-NA65, and the Panasonic Nanoe EH-NA67 were all slower, heavier, and more expensive than the Rusk W8less. We previously recommended the Conair 1875-Watt Tourmaline Ceramic Styling System as a budget option. However, the short, 5-foot cord has been enough of a pain for us to use in the setups we’ve tested that we suggest going with our current budget pick, the InfinitiPro by Conair 1875-Watt Salon Performance AC Motor Styling Tool, which has a longer cord, if you need a very inexpensive dryer. If weight is your primary concern, though, the 1875-Watt Tourmaline Ceramic Styling System is still worth considering: At 0.91 pound, this model is lighter than our budget pick. The Revlon 1875-Watt Infrared Hair Dryer produced a wind speed of 45 mph (measured directly in front of the nozzle), slower than the speed we got from our picks. It weighs just over a pound, has a cord measuring 5.5 feet, and comes with a concentrator and a diffuser. But the mediocre specs, along with the gimmicky red lights that flash while you’re blow-drying, kept this dryer from being a pick, even though it was a particularly inexpensive model at the time of our tests. Although the 1,875-watt Revlon Compact Styler is a wallet-saver at around $10, the savings do not make up for the dryer’s added heft, its lack of attachments, and its reduced wind speeds compared with our picks. The Gold ’N Hot Ultra-Lightweight Dryer with Tourmaline is the lightest dryer we’ve tested, at 0.6 pound. However, the measured air speed was only 45 mph, and we found the handle thick and awkward to hold. We found that the handle on the Remington T-Studio Pearl Ceramic Professional AC Hair Dryer AC2015 vibrated unpleasantly when we put it on its highest speed setting. The Remington Damage Protection Hair Dryer D3190 comes with a diffuser and concentrator but is bulkier and heavier than other models we tested. In our testing, the BaBylissPro Nano Titanium Hair Dryer produced a whining sound that was worse than any noise from competitors. The Bio Ionic 10X Ultralight Speed Dryer is a tad lighter (0.92 pound) than our top pick and has a slightly longer cord. However, the dryer doesn’t have separate wind-speed and temperature-control settings (if you want hot air, it must also be fast). The Drybar Buttercup Blow Dryer is heavier than our picks, at 1.3 pounds. The air speed is also slower, at just over 30 mph measured at a distance of 2 inches. Elchim offers an impressive warranty and repair program that covers all its hair dryers. At 1.2 pounds, however, the Elchim Classic 2001 is heavier than our picks, and we found the handle to be thick and awkward to hold. Amazon customer reviews of the 1,900-watt Parlux 3200 Hair Dryer were pretty good at the time of our research, and the compact design is nice. But the buttons on this model are positioned on the side, and they made the dryer hard for us to hold without getting poked in the hand. The DevaDryer by DevaCurl is slower and heavier than our picks. However, after a few wash-and-go tests, our curly-haired testers found that they liked using the included DevaFuser attachment, a unique hand-shaped diffuser that helps dry curls and waves without losing definition. You can buy a universal-fit version of the DevaFuser for any attachment-compatible hair dryer. The Conair 1875-Watt 3-in-1 Ionic Styler has a long row of grills (and a brush attachment) instead of a circular nozzle. It gives you no way to attach a diffuser, which means you’re stuck with a single-purpose dryer.

57,https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-space-heaters/,The Best Space Heaters for 2021 | Reviews by Wirecutter,FYI,"Wirecutter is reader-supported. When you buy through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more FYI  After some additional testing, we’ve added the Lasko CD08200 bathroom heater as a new pick.  October 6, 2021 To offset the chill in a drafty room or to give your home’s heating system a little boost, you may need a space heater. We’ve researched more than 100 models and tested 67 since 2011, and the Vornado VH200 is the best space heater for most people. A lot of space heaters can make you feel like you’re sitting in front of a hair dryer, but our pick (and other Vornado heaters we tried) warmed an entire room faster and more comfortably than everything else we’ve tested. The Vornado VH200 heated a room faster and more evenly than other models we tested, offering the best combination of power, comfort, and quietness. In our tests, the Vornado VH200 surpassed almost every other space heater in speed and total power, delivering an immediate temperature increase that built steadily and evenly across the room over the course of an hour. The VH200 is also quieter than most other ceramic heaters we’ve tried, emitting only a soft, fanlike whir, and it’s compact enough to tuck away in a corner. It’s also one of the safest heaters we tested, featuring overheating and tip-over protection, and a plastic exterior that stays relatively cool to the touch—so you can warm yourself without having to worry. The VH200 does get mixed reviews from some owners who find it slow to heat a particularly cold space or have problems with the airflow from the fan (the heat only blasts in one direction, and while the fan should help to circulate the air around the room, the heat blast can be a little overwhelming). Fortunately, Vornado tends to respond to these critical reviews more reliably than other manufacturers do. Advertisement The Vornado AVH10 was the most powerful space heater we tested, with a few thoughtful details that set it apart from others. But it tends to cost more. The Vornado AVH10 is a lot like the VH200, with a few added features, such as a digital display, a convenient cord-wrapping post for easy storage, and a countdown clock when you turn it off, for added safety. In our tests, the AVH10 was the absolute hottest room heater model we tested, warming the room more quickly and to a higher temperature than the VH200. However, the AVH10 didn’t distribute its hot air as evenly throughout the space as the VH200, and it also tends to cost between $30 and $50 more. Still, it’s a great alternative to our top pick if you find it for a good price, or if you prefer its extra features. This effective portable heater works quickly and lasts for years. But its narrow stream of hot air doesn’t feel as comfortable as the heat from models that warm a whole room, and it lacks some safety features. *At the time of publishing, the price was $27. We’ve recommended the Lasko 754200 Ceramic Heater since 2013, and it’s still one of the cheapest and most reliable space heaters you can find. It warms up faster than most fan heaters we tested, and it has a compact, lightweight body that’s about the size of a loaf of bread. The heat is a focused stream of hot air, which warms the area directly in front of the space heater. But it isn’t as comfortable as the broad, room-filling heat we preferred from the Vornado models. The Lasko struggles in larger spaces as a result, but it’s perfect for warming a home office or for quickly heating up a small bedroom. The 754200 has had consistently positive owner reviews for years, and many Wirecutter staff members have owned one for multiple winters with few complaints. It lacks an automatic tip-over kill switch, a safety feature included in our top pick, and it’s not the best-looking option, but it does feature overheat protection. Oil-filled radiators are silent but slow. The TRD40615T is the best of its type because it’s sturdier than competitors, with an exterior that stays cooler to the touch. *At the time of publishing, the price was $168. Most space heaters can deliver quick heat to a single person, but oil-filled radiators are better for heating a whole room for a longer duration, and the De’Longhi TRD40615T is the best of its kind. Like most oil-filled radiators, the TRD40615T warms up much more slowly than a ceramic heater, but it also retains its heat for longer, making it more energy-efficient. With a burly, all-metal construction that’s more durable than the builds of our other, plastic-clad picks, this De’Longhi model is sturdier and more attractive than any other oil-filled radiator we tested, and it’s also cooler to the touch. This attractive obelisk has all the heating prowess Vornados are known for, plus the ability to oscillate, which helps the heat to spread more evenly around the room. May be out of stock *At the time of publishing, the price was $110. The Vornado OSCTH1 stands out not only for its stylish appearance, but also because it’s the rare Vornado that oscillates instead of blasting the heat straight ahead and hoping the airflow fills the room eventually. While it won’t warm you up quite as quickly as our other Vornado picks, the steady arc of motion means a more comfortable and uniform heating throughout your space. It also just looks great, in a subtly sci-fi sort of way, with easy-to-use digital touch screen controls and all the same safety features we usually look for, like a tip-over switch and overheat protection. The Lasko FH500 towers above its competition both in features and in stature, providing an even, vertical distribution of air. It definitely stands out in a room, but at least it looks good. *At the time of publishing, the price was $95. The 3½-foot-tall Lasko FH500 All Season Comfort Control Tower Fan & Heater in One is easily the tallest space heater we tested—but it doesn’t actually take up that much floor space for a room heater. In our tests, it warmed the room swiftly and consistently to the temperature we dialed in on its digital display, and then it steadily held that temperature until the end of the hour. The FH500 is full of thoughtful details, including an easy-to-navigate control panel and a matching remote control. It also has a medium heating option (in addition to the standard high and low settings found on most other space heaters), as well as a timer and an “auto eco” setting for better energy efficiency. While we’ve had concerns about the longevity of tower fans in the past, the Lasko has held up well after a year of continuous use (though we’ll continue to keep an eye out). Speaking of fans—the Lasko also has a built-in cooling feature, which is a nice bonus. The VHEAT’s solid heating performance is secondary to its delightful design, which makes it a great choice if you’re more concerned with aesthetics. *At the time of publishing, the price was $150. The Vornado VHEAT Vintage Heater heats well enough and looks good doing it. With a solid metal construction and wonderfully retro knobs, it’s simply the best-looking electric space heater we’ve found that doesn’t sacrifice (too much) functionality. Though the VHEAT delivers a steady stream of air that quickly heats whatever’s right in front of it, it wasn’t as good at spreading that heat around the room, resulting in a 10-degree difference in the temperature measurements we took from different parts of the room during our tests. The fact that it was able to heat part of the room enough to create a 10-degree difference was still pretty remarkable, however. Some space heaters we tested couldn’t even warm a room by 5 degrees. Overall, we think the VHEAT is a great choice for anyone interested in aesthetics as well as comfort. If you absolutely need to have an electric heater in the bathroom (or somewhere else where it can get wet), the Lasko CD08200 is the only one we’d recommend to do the job safely. The Lasko CD08200 bathroom heater is the most effective and — more importantly — safe way to bring some infrared warmth to your bathroom. Generally speaking, you should try to keep electricity (especially something as powerful as a space heater) far, far away from any situation where it might get wet. While you might be tempted to bring our other picks into the bathroom with you, the Lasko is only one equipped with the proper safety features to mitigate the risk of electrocution (though you should still try to keep it far away from the water). It’s also quick to warm the room and incredibly easy to use, with one large button on the top that automatically defaults to a one-hour heating timer. That should give you enough time to shower and build up the courage to leave the comfort of the warm rushing water — but even if it doesn’t, the Lasko has the normal high and low heating settings as well. Whichever space heater you choose, there are some common safety concerns that many people overlook: You can’t use any space heater with an extension cord, and you shouldn’t leave a heater unattended. And most heaters can’t be used in a bathroom, unless they’re specifically designed for it. We go over these and other considerations in detail in our section on space-heater care, maintenance, and safety. The Vornado VH200 heated a room faster and more evenly than other models we tested, offering the best combination of power, comfort, and quietness. The Vornado AVH10 was the most powerful space heater we tested, with a few thoughtful details that set it apart from others. But it tends to cost more.

If you absolutely need to have an electric heater in the bathroom (or somewhere else where it can get wet), the Lasko CD08200 is the only one we’d recommend to do the job safely. We’ve been covering space heaters since 2011, and in that time we’ve considered more than 150 different models and tested more than 60 of them. We’ve interviewed experts on heating, including Joel Hawk, principal engineer manager at the global safety certification company UL; Linda Hotz, category director, and John Mayer, associate category manager, for the Home Comfort team at De’Longhi; a team of representatives from Vornado; and Gary McCall, former fire adviser to the Office of the Fire Commissioner for British Columbia’s Vancouver Island Region. In the earliest versions of this guide, we relied on the testing expertise of physicist Jim Shapiro, who tested heaters at his home in the high desert of Colorado and also served as an expert source during our research. Since 2017, we’ve focused more on real-world testing, running the heaters under controlled conditions in cramped apartments in Boston and New York. We pored over independent testing data and scientific research from Good Housekeeping, the U.S. Fire Administration (PDF), the U.S. Department of Energy, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, and the National Fire Protection Association. The single most important takeaway from this research is that space heaters are one of the leading causes of house fires in the US. As such, we placed heightened importance on each portable heater’s safety measures and track record. The current version of this guide was written by Thom Dunn, who has written Wirecutter guides on portable and window air conditioners, as well as on emergency weather radios, Bluetooth car kits, hose-end sprinklers, and more. He also learned the hard way that plugging a space heater and a half-stack Marshall guitar amp into the same power strip can cause some pyrotechnics (and not the cool, rock ’n’ roll kind). His work on space heaters builds on previous research and writing by Sabrina Imbler, who wrote the 2018 update; Tyler Wells Lynch, who wrote the 2017 update; and Séamus Bellamy, who wrote this guide from 2011 through 2016. Although space heaters generally shouldn’t be used to heat an entire building, they are a great way to supplement the warmth in specific rooms. Perhaps there’s an area of your home that has noticeably poorer heat distribution. Or maybe you want to save money by spot-heating a room (or yourself!) instead of wasting energy by filling the entire space with hot air or pumping heat into a room with no one in it. Maybe your office is too cold and you want a small, personal heater to keep at your desk. Generating heat can require significant wattage, though, and there are a few situations space heaters are not suited for—we cover those in our section on space-heater care, maintenance, and safety. If you do think you may need a new heater, don’t wait for the cold weather to hit. Retailers usually stock space heaters seasonally, so prices and availability can fluctuate over the colder months. We’ve updated this guide every year since 2011, building on our knowledge of and experience with the features that set a great space heater apart from the rest. We start by researching all of the new space heaters released in a given year, along with popular competitors, whether or not we’ve previously tested them. Our research has led us to focus on two prominent types: compact electric heaters with fans and oil-filled radiators. Most portable heaters we’ve tested in the past do a fine job of emitting heat, but after living with and using these heaters over time, we’ve discovered some very specific differences. Some heaters that heat well are infuriatingly difficult to clean, have nonsensical interfaces, or sound like wasps. Others are easy to clean, intuitive to use, and silent, in addition to being effective heaters. So we took careful notes on what it was like to rely on and work alongside these heaters. We also factored in customer reviews, especially those from people who’ve owned a particular space heater for an extended period of time. We pored over space heater reviews on Amazon, Walmart, and Home Depot, hunting for any patterns of defects or longevity issues. With all this in mind, we prioritized the following features and performance criteria: We follow a similar testing procedure for space heaters every year: placing each space heater in the same location in a 200-square-foot bedroom, with the doors and windows closed. Since 2019, we’ve tested 20 different models in a Boston apartment. In order to track the conditions in the room, we placed a Lascar data logger directly in front of the heater at a distance of 3 feet and placed another diagonally, at a distance of 6 feet, to see how well the heat moved around the room. We ran each heater for an hour; the Lascar logger measured the temperature and humidity every five minutes. We focused our data on the overall changes in our measurements, rather than specific temperatures—noting that a model raised the temperature by 15 degrees, for example, instead of noting that the room reached a temperature of 95 degrees Fahrenheit (it was difficult to perfectly control the conditions in our test room in the middle of August). After running each space heater for an hour on its hottest setting, we used an infrared thermometer gun to measure (on ceramic heaters) both the plastic casing and the grille covering the main heating element, to see how hot they got. With radiators, we took readings of the radiator fins and the plastic control panels. We also measured the noises that the heaters emitted, taking readings with a decibel meter from distances of 3 feet and 6 feet. We noted both dBA and dBC weightings—the former cuts off the lower and higher frequencies that most people can’t hear, and the latter picks up higher frequencies. In addition to this objective data, we took extensive subjective notes on how warm each electric heater made us feel. Even the most perfect, lablike conditions can’t reveal what it’s like to operate the knobs on a heater, how its heat feels, or what it would be like to live with a particular heater over the winter. The Vornado VH200 heated a room faster and more evenly than other models we tested, offering the best combination of power, comfort, and quietness. Out of all the space heaters we’ve tested, the Vornado VH200 offers the best overall combination of heating speed and distribution, safety features, easy operation, and affordability. Plus, it’s just generally pleasant to live with. The VH200 was also quieter than every other fan-based heater we tested, emitting a soft whir that was barely noticeable—even on high—and generating a comfortably focused blast of heat that evenly dissipated into a room-filling, ambient warmth. It’s simply the best space heater we tested. We found the VH200’s analog dials easy to handle and intuitive to master, and we appreciate that it has a medium heat setting, whereas most heaters have only low and high settings. And although the VH200 is not particularly attractive, it’s definitely not ugly—a big win in a crowded field of unappealing design. Even its negative owner reviews are less of a red flag than those of some competitors, with reports of responsive customer service from the manufacturer that you rarely see among reviews of other brands. The Vornado VH200, as well as other Vornado models we tested, proved significantly more effective than most other space heaters in our evaluation. After running on high for 15 minutes, the VH200 raised the temperature by 6 degrees Fahrenheit at 3 feet away, and by 3 degrees at a 6-foot diagonal; after an hour, the VH200 had increased the temperature by 17 degrees at 3 feet away, and by 11 degrees at a 6-foot diagonal. This resulted in a 6-degree difference across the room. Other Vornado models we tested (including our runner-up pick, the Vornado AVH10, and the also-great Vornado VHEAT) produced more heat more quickly, but none of them distributed the hot air as evenly as the VH200, with differences of 8 to 10 degrees throughout the room. Other models, including the Lasko 754200 and the Vornado OSCTH1, warmed the room more evenly than the VH200, but they didn’t get nearly as hot in the same amount of time. In spite of the hotter temperature readings, the heat billowing from the VH200 also felt significantly more comfortable to sit beside than that of the other heaters we tested. That’s because its fan design—what Vornado calls a “circulator”—distributed a gentle, even heat to every corner of the room, similar to what we observed in our testing of Vornado room fans. The result: an all-encompassing and diffuse heat that felt natural, not forced. By contrast, the ceramic-plate models we tested (such as our budget pick from Lasko) delivered a narrow beam of heated air that made sweat trickle down our necks when we sat directly in the line of fire. The Vornado VH200 has every safety feature we look for in a space heater, including overheat protection, a tip-over switch, and UL certification. Though the tip-over switch on the VH200 might seem overly aggressive to some people, it’s ultimately for the best—that mild inconvenience will help remind you that there’s only one safe place for your space heater, and that’s with all 4 corners touching the floor. Other electric heater models, like the De’Longhi TCH7915ER, had tip-over switches that activated only when they were perfectly horizontal, which means they could possibly fall or lean over and continue running. Some less expensive heaters, including our budget pick, the Lasko 754200 don’t have a tip-over switch at all. Every model we tested had overheat protection built in, but some of them, like the Vornado Glide and the Vornado MVH, were too aggressive, shutting down for hours on end when they reached temperatures in the mid-80s. The VH200’s plastic casing also remained relatively cool, measuring around 95 degrees Fahrenheit, with the grille over the heating element topping out at around 140 degrees, making it one of the coolest models we tested. Although space-heater safety largely depends on using the heater correctly, all of these features are still reassuring. Despite its abundant heating ability, the VH200 operated with a quiet murmur that we didn’t find distracting or unpleasant. We recorded a decibel level of 45 dBA at a distance of 3 feet and 44 dBA at 6 feet at the heater’s highest setting, levels that are quieter than a fan on its lowest setting. And if you use the VH200 at any fan setting below 4, the fan switches off and the machine emits a near-silent heat. But even on high, the Vornado VH200 is significantly quieter than the Lasko 754200, which recorded decibel measurements of 52 dBA at a distance of 3 feet and 51 dBA at 6 feet. This Vornado model is not as quiet as a radiator, but no other kind of space heater is, and it’s still quieter than a household refrigerator. The VH200 has a slim, lightweight design that’s easy to tuck under a desk or in a corner. It’s also pleasantly pear-shaped (bottom-heavy heaters are harder to tip over). It’s certainly bigger than most of the personal heaters we tested, but it’s dwarfed by any radiator. Weighing about 3½ pounds, it’s about the size of a coffee maker. We found the controls on the VH200 simple, straightforward, and durable. The space heater offers three power settings—one more than the usual low and high—and a thermostat dial with seven settings. It has a red LED indicator that remains on when the heater is on and turns off when the heater is powered down but still plugged in, such as when the heater is automatically maintaining the desired temperature of a room. This can be a little confusing, leading you to wonder whether your heater has stopped working. But we still preferred it to the Lasko 754200’s crimson indicator light, which blared bright even when the plugged-in heater was turned off. The VH200 also has an internal thermostat that can automatically turn on and off to maintain temperature. To activate it, simply turn the knob past your ideal temperature setting and then turn it back until you hear a click, and the VH200 will self-regulate to maintain the room temperature where you want it, within about one degree. This feature worked successfully in our testing, keeping the temperature steady within about one degree from 3 feet away for more than 6 hours. You might find the results disappointing, however, if you’re hoping to keep the room at a specific temperature; you can set the knob to “4” because it’s comfortable, for example, but you can’t make that translate directly to 72 degrees. But overall, it’s still a nice feature to have. The VH200 comes with an impressive five-year warranty, two more years of coverage than the Lasko. In our research into owner reviews of the VH200, we noticed that Vornado representatives responded to most of the negative Amazon reviews of the VH200 and offered to replace broken or malfunctioning fans; reviews were also updated to reflect positive experiences with Vornado customer service. The VH200 is more than twice as expensive as other portable ceramic heating options, such as the Lasko—but it tends to cost less than other comparable Vornado models. We believe the VH200 is worth the price due to its pleasant, even heating and the fact that it can raise the temperature of a room so much more effectively than the other models we tested. It also lacks a fan-only mode (which is really only a bummer because room fans are Vornado’s primary area of expertise). One minor complaint: The grip on the back of the VH200 is a bit shallow and has neither a lip nor a grippy texture, and the heater itself tends to tip forward in a front-heavy imbalance when you pick it up. This means it’s pretty easy to lift the heater up and immediately drop it—maybe on your foot. You can work around that by hooking your thumb around the front side of the heater or supporting it from below with a second hand. And (though this doesn’t affect our pick) we think it’s important to note that Vornado recalled a similar model in 2018, in response to more than a dozen reports of that model overheating and catching fire. The VH101, the model affected by the recall, is about 7.2 inches deep, 7.8 inches wide, and 7.10 inches high. Our pick is a bit bigger, at about 10.4 inches deep, 9.2 inches wide, and 10.6 inches high. If you have a small Vornado heater, check the model number, and if you have the VH101, Vornado will give you a full refund or replace the product—possibly with that model’s replacement, the VH202. According to a Vornado spokesperson, the larger Vornado we recommend has improved safety features that the recalled VH101 lacked: a flame-retardant resin; UL 3122 wire jacketing, a high-temperature, high-voltage silicone/fiberglass jacketing; and a change in the soldering of the heater’s electronics. The Vornado AVH10 was the most powerful space heater we tested, with a few thoughtful details that set it apart from others. But it tends to cost more. The Vornado AVH10 has a digital display, which will delight some people and frustrate others, because you have to manually tap a button numerous times to reach your desired temperature, up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. (On the VH200, all you have to do is turn a knob, which is convenient, even if there’s no way to know the exact temperature.) Luckily, the buttons on the AVH10 are large and easy to locate, even in the dark. It also comes with a convenient cord-wrapping post for tidier storage. When you turn off the AVH10, there’s a countdown on the digital screen, reminding you to wait 10 seconds for it to cool down before you unplug or move it. In our portable heater tests, the AVH10 actually provided more heat more quickly than the VH200, but the heat wasn’t distributed very evenly. After just 15 minutes, the AVH10 increased the room temperature by a whopping 18 degrees from 3 feet away, with a total improvement of 24 degrees after an hour. However, the difference between our measurements was noticeable—the temperature from 6 feet away on a diagonal increased by only 3 degrees after 15 minutes, and by 7 degrees total after an hour, resulting in a temperature range of 16 degrees across just a few feet of the room. The other big difference between the VH200 and the AVH10 is the price: The digital display and the cord-wrapping feature add a premium of about $30. Still, if you’re willing to pay that much for a similar (albeit less even) heating performance, the AVH10 is a fine alternative. This effective portable heater works quickly and lasts for years. But its narrow stream of hot air doesn’t feel as comfortable as the heat from models that warm a whole room, and it lacks some safety features. *At the time of publishing, the price was $27. The Lasko 754200 Ceramic Heater is a small, budget option if you’re looking to warm just your body—not the room as a whole—while you’re sitting on the couch, say, or in the office. It was our top pick for years, and although we’ve now found other space heater models that are more powerful, or quieter, or just more comfortable, the Lasko remains a steadfast competitor and a solid choice. However, this Lasko model lacks a tip-over switch, a reassuring and basic safety feature that automatically powers down the machine if it falls over. Also, unlike the Vornado VH200’s soothing, ambient heat, the 754200’s heat feels more like that of a supersize hair dryer—and if you sit close enough, it sounds like one, too. But the 754200 is smaller than the VH200 and therefore easier to store or tuck away. It’s not much to look at, unless you’re really into fencing masks, but it is powerful and affordable, and that’s really all you need. As is the case with all ceramic heaters, the 754200 creates a concentrated jet of warm air that you can feel almost immediately, especially if you’re sitting right in front of it. After running on high for an hour, the Lasko raised the temperature of our room from 6 feet away by 10 degrees Fahrenheit, a performance close to that of the Vornado VH200. Though the Lasko raised the temperature by only about 7 degrees when measured from 3 feet away, the overall temperature in the room remained fairly consistent across both measurements, fluctuating within about 2 to 3 degrees. This actually came as a surprise when we looked at the data, as our initial gut-check left us feeling like the heat had not been evenly distributed. Your best bet is to place the Lasko space heater right in front of you and to enjoy the direct blast of hot air, then be pleasantly surprised when you find that heat fills the rest of the air around you. The Lasko is also appealingly simple to use. In addition to its molded-plastic carrying handle, it has intuitive controls consisting of two physical dials that are easy to grasp and manipulate. One dial controls the power output, the two heat settings (high and low), and the fan-only option, while the other controls the thermostat. Weighing a little over 3 pounds and measuring about the size of a loaf of bread, it can stash pretty much anywhere, too. The Lasko 754200’s biggest failing is its lack of a tip-over kill switch, which is a pretty standard safety feature for portable space heaters. (The model is ETL certified.) Tipped-over heaters tend to overheat, and this Lasko model’s upright stance is not the most stable. In contrast, we found the squat, pyramidal Vornado heaters much harder to knock over. Although we recommend that you don’t leave any space heaters unattended in a room at any time, especially with pets or small children, we stress that even more when living with the Lasko. It does come with overheat protection, which cuts power to certain areas of the heating element if they get too hot. Despite these safety concerns, the Lasko space heater is relatively cool to the touch—or at least not as hot—topping out at around 100 degrees Fahrenheit on the plastic casing after running for an hour. The grille directly in front of the ceramic plate reached about 160 degrees, which is still hot enough to burn your skin, but cooler than some of the other ceramic models we tested (and many that we didn’t test). Fortunately, the molded-plastic carrying handle is built in to the backside of the Lasko, far away from the grille, so you can transport it without the risk of getting burned. The Lasko 754200 was one of the loudest electric heaters we tested—about 7 dBA louder than the Vornado VH200, but still quieter than the Vornado VHEAT or our previous pick, the Honeywell UberHeat HCE200W. The sound it emits is not unpleasant, per se, but it is gravelly enough that you might find it irritating after a while. The Lasko 754200’s biggest selling point is that it’s frequently one of the cheapest space heaters you can find. Prices for space heaters can shift dramatically from season to season, but at Amazon, Walmart, or Home Depot, the 754200 rarely exceeds $30—about half the price of the VH200. The 754200 is consistently one of the most popular space heaters on Amazon, with largely positive user reviews. We found similar, if not better, levels of satisfaction at the Walmart, Home Depot, and Best Buy sites. But a quick dive into the negative owner reviews reveals a number of incidents where the heater overheated even when plugged directly into a wall outlet. We’ve been recommending the Lasko as a pick since 2013—first as our top pick, and later as a runner-up—and we have extensive notes that can attest to its long-term durability. Several Wirecutter staff members have owned the Lasko 754200 for a few winters now and have next to no complaints about its long-term operation. Oil-filled radiators are silent but slow. The TRD40615T is the best of its type because it’s sturdier than competitors, with an exterior that stays cooler to the touch. *At the time of publishing, the price was $168. Although oil-filled radiators look classic, they are not as effective as ceramic and open-element ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eaters at distributing heat throughout a room. They’re bigger, more expensive, and slower to heat up,NA, their heat can feel more comfortable than heat directed out by a fan, and some people prefer their all-metal construction to plastic, since they are small machines reaching high temperatures. If this kind of room heater sounds like something you might prefer, our favorite oil-filled heater is the De’Longhi TRD40615T. It’s sturdier and easier to clean than any other radiator we tested, with a shell-like exterior that remains relatively cool to the touch (for a radiator) and is easier to wipe down than those of most radiators (which typically feature bare fins that gather dust in hard-to-reach depths). We also love its simple, manual controls. Like any oil-filled radiator, the De’Longhi TRD40615T does not produce instantaneous heat. It takes about half an hour to heat up at all, and even after running on high for an hour, the TRD40615T raised the temperature of our test room by only 2 degrees Fahrenheit from 3 feet away and 3 degrees from 6 feet away—significantly less than the Lasko and Vornado models. But unlike ceramic heaters, which cool off immediately after powering down, oil-filled radiators like the TRD40615T are designed to retain enough thermal mass that they keep emitting heat even after you turn them off. In our tests the TRD40615T did this well—starting at 80 degrees Fahrenheit, then building up to 89 degrees over two and a half hours, without dropping back down to 80 for almost four hours after that. Though these exact measurements shouldn’t be taken as gospel—we were testing in a cool basement room, but it was the middle of August, when it’s already hot and humid outside—they do demonstrate the value and function of an oil-filled radiator. Another benefit of oil-filled radiators is that they make absolutely no noise, unlike ceramic, open-element, or micathermic heaters. If, like me, you ever find yourself needing a space heater in a music recording studio, this is the one to go with—although you shouldn’t plug it into the same outlet as your Marshall half-stack, unless you really want to see that outlet explode. (You don’t.) Like any radiator, the De’Longhi TRD40615T is larger than our other picks. It occupies 16 by 6.6 by 25 inches of space, about the same size as a full-size suitcase. If you live in a cramped space, this heater may take up room you can’t spare. All radiators are hot to the touch, and this De’Longhi model is no exception. However, its flat, articulated exoskeleton helps ensure that the exterior is much cooler to the touch than the exposed fins inside. It still gets to about 180 degrees Fahrenheit on the outside, but that’s much cooler than the 230 degrees we measured on the inside. That doesn’t mean the TRD40615T is safe to touch—any temperature above 160 degrees Fahrenheit will burn skin upon contact, so you still need to be careful. But at least it’s moderately safer than traditionally designed radiators like the Pelonis NY1507-14A and the De’Longhi EW7707CM, which reached exterior temperatures of 225 degrees Fahrenheit when we’ve tested them in previous years. The TRD40615T has manual controls that are intuitive to use, as well as a 24-hour programmable timer, which comes in handy. The electric heater has three different heat options and a thermostat dial that ranges from 1 to 6. This model is also easy to move, since you can roll it around on four retractable wheels. We liked that we didn’t have to install or screw in the wheels on the De’Longhi, unlike on the Pelonis NY1507-14A. The wheels on the TRD40615T can also be moved underneath the unit to prevent it from rolling. Though this does make the TRD40615T a little top heavy, it was much more stable than other radiators we tested, including the KH390715CB, also from De’Longhi. Some Amazon customers have complained about the radiator giving off an unpleasant smell upon initial use, and the company acknowledges this, too. We recommend running it outside to let it off-gas before taking it inside (keep it dry and away from dirt or grass while you do this). Most other oil-filled radiators initially emit this noxious stench because some of the oil remains on the surface of the heater after manufacturing. Once the oil has evaporated, the smell disappears. A few space heater reviews have complained that the timer makes an audible ticking noise, but we did not encounter this issue in our testing. If you encounter this issue, we recommend that you contact the manufacturer. The De’Longhi TRD40615T has a warranty of one year, so it should be covered if the ticking emerges early on. This attractive obelisk has all the heating prowess Vornados are known for, plus the ability to oscillate, which helps the heat to spread more evenly around the room. May be out of stock *At the time of publishing, the price was $110. If you want a heater with the power of a Vornado that also oscillates to spread the heat evenly around the room, get the Vornado OSCTH1. It’s comparable to the VH200 in a lot of ways, and we think it’s a good alternative overall for smooth, gradual whole-room heating. It also has a nice digital touch screen, with simple controls and an easy-to-read temperature display. In addition to the standard safety features that we look for, such as overheat protection and a tip-over switch, the OSCTH1 also has a Cool Down feature that counts down from 8 when you turn it off, to make sure you don’t touch it while it’s still hot (it was one of the cooler-to-touch models we tested in 2020, but you can never be too careful). The OSCTH1 is a sleek tower fan about a foot and a half tall that looks kind of like a miniature (and much less ominous) version of the Monoliths from 2001: A Space Odyssey, with a clear plastic touchscreen display on the top. The digital thermometer only goes up to 90, like on the Lasko FH500 tower heater, but we don’t think you’ll need any more heat than that. In our tests, it was surprisingly good at maintaining this temperature, too. Within 20 minutes, the room had jumped from the 70s up to 85 degrees Fahrenheit (about 8 degrees measured from 6 feet away, or 5 degrees from 3 feet) and slowly crept up toward 90 from there over the rest of the hour. During that time, we only measured an average of less than 1 degree difference in room temperature from our two temperature monitors at 3 feet in front of the heater and 6 feet diagonal from it—some of the most uniform heat distribution we’ve seen. And although it doesn’t have a cooling feature like the Lasko FH500, the OSCTH1 does have a fan-only mode, which is great for air circulation. That circulation comes with a catch, however: Because the OSCTH1 moves the air around the room so well, it doesn’t raise the overall temperature quite as quickly as the VH200 does. We think this is a fair trade-off if you’re looking to warm a space instead of a single person, but it might not be ideal in every situation. Wirecutter editor Joshua Lyons, who has been long-term testing this model in a room with no other heat source, finds the effect frustrating at times. “With other space heaters, I get the immediate blast of hot air that I want in a freezing room,” he said. Despite that caveat, he still finds much to love: “Once the OSCTH1 is up and running, the temperature remains consistent. I’ve never had this happen with a space heater before. I usually find myself constantly fiddling with the temperature dial to adjust the heat up or down.” The OSCTH1 is also about 4 decibels louder than the VH200, although it still rates below “conversation level.” We think the white noise it emits should be easy enough for most people to ignore (we found it rather pleasant ourselves). Because it is technically a tower heater, you will need to occasionally vacuum up or blow out the dust that gathers in the OSCTH1’s filter over time, as well. Such filters are a large part of why we don’t recommend tower fans for cooling; although we’ve found the experience less frustrating with heaters, it’s still not ideal. If you let the dust build up, it can interfere with the touchscreen mechanism—and you need to turn the heater off in order to clean it, or else risk messing with the touchscreen even more. Fortunately, if the filters do get blocked, the OSCTH1 has a built-in automatic shut-off system, so the hot air and dust don’t combust into bigger problems. And if anything does go wrong, the OSCTH1 is backed by an impressive five-year warranty like all the other Vornado models we recommend. Overall, the OSCTH11 is a great choice if you want to share the warmth with other people in the same room, or just want a steady, balanced control of heat across a space. Also, it just looks great as it subtly oscillates back and forth in the corner of the room like an extraterrestrial portent. We continue to be impressed with the OSCTH1’s circulation and its even (albeit gradual) heating. However, we have noticed that it occasionally makes a loud grinding sound while oscillating—something that a few other Amazon reviews have noted, as well. It’s not clear to us whether this sound is the result of some damage accrued in shipping or just the way the heater was built; either way, you can easily remedy the problem by picking up the heater and placing it back down again. In addition to his aforementioned frustrations with the OSCTH1’s slow heating, Wirecutter editor Joshua Lyon also warns that his cats like to jump on top of the oscillating tower, and that the touchscreen responds to the pads of their paws. If you’re a cat owner, though, you’re probably already used to that sort of chaos. The Lasko FH500 towers above its competition both in features and in stature, providing an even, vertical distribution of air. It definitely stands out in a room, but at least it looks good. *At the time of publishing, the price was $95. The Lasko FH500 All Season Comfort Control Tower Fan & Heater in One is the best tower heater we tested, directing a vertical column of warm air evenly throughout the room. At 3½ feet tall, it’s also the largest one we tested, although it’s nice enough in function and appearance that we wouldn’t mind having it stand out in our home. And despite its height, the FH500 actually has only about a 13-by-13-inch footprint, which makes it a great space-saver. In our tests, we set the FH500’s bright, easy-to-read digital display to 90 degrees Fahrenheit, the highest possible setting (you can also set the thermostat to display in Celsius). From our measurements at both 3 feet and 6 feet, it took the FH500 about 45 minutes to raise the 8 degrees needed to reach our target temperature. Though this was a slower temperature increase than with some of our other picks (including the VH200 and AVH10), we were impressed by how evenly the temperature rose across the room. What was even more remarkable was that as soon as the room reached 90 degrees Fahrenheit, the FH500 kept the temperature there for the rest of the hour. As the tower heater oscillated, it emitted a low, gentle wooshing sound that was too quiet to measure beneath the hum of the urban streets outside. Unlike most other models we tested, the FH500 has three built-in heating settings, so it offers more heating flexibility for maximum comfort. It also has four fan modes (including fan-only). The FH500 room heater comes with a large remote control that can be stored in an attached pocket on the back of the tower. The buttons are clearly marked, matching the controls on the tower itself, including the digital temperature display, the timer, and the Auto Eco setting. The FH500 was the only electric space heater model we tested that required some minor assembly for the base. Fortunately, it doesn’t require any tools—although the size of the tower can make it a bit difficult to balance while you attach the two pieces, which are held on by thumb screws. We do have a couple of reservations in recommending the FH500, in spite of its strong test performance. For one, it’s newer to the market, so it hasn’t yet proved the test of time like our other picks have. And it has a tower design, which on tower fans can be so difficult to clean that they can become inoperable after a season or two. We’re reassured by the fact that the FH500 is covered by Lasko’s three-year warranty, and we’re optimistic that the dust and dirt factor won’t be as much of a problem for a heater, because you’re more likely to be using it indoors with the windows closed. Of course, that’s assuming you don’t take advantage of its ability to operate as a fan only. All that being said, the Lasko has continued to perform well in both heating and cooling capacities after a year of continued use. The VHEAT’s solid heating performance is secondary to its delightful design, which makes it a great choice if you’re more concerned with aesthetics. *At the time of publishing, the price was $150. The Vornado VHEAT Vintage Heater is an all-around decent heater, but what really sets it apart is its delightful aesthetic, inspired by the original Vornado design from 1945. At nearly 9 pounds, the VHEAT’s metal body is noticeably heavier than the plastic Vornado models we tested, and its sea-foam green finish (also available in white) makes it feel like a deliberate choice of home decor, rather than, well, a small plastic space heater that you bought out of necessity. In our heating tests, the VHEAT performed near the top of the pack, even if it wasn’t quite as good as the VH200 or the AVH10 space heaters, or any of our other non-Vornado picks. The VHEAT was able to raise the temperature in the room by 11 degrees in just 15 minutes when measured from 3 feet in front of the fan. But when we measured the temperature at 6 feet away, out of the fan’s direct line of sight, it had risen by only 4 degrees in that same amount of time. By the end of the hour, there was a 10-degree difference between our measurements at 3 feet in front of the fan and at 6 feet on an angle. This uneven distribution shouldn’t be a problem if you plan on placing the VHEAT directly in front of you. Despite its metal exterior, the VHEAT also remained surprisingly cool to the touch—only about 100 degrees Fahrenheit on the sides, and 140 on the grille, and it cooled down even further within minutes of shutting off. And though its low, gentle humming sound is louder than the sounds of some of our other picks—about 56 dbA from 3 feet away or 57 dbA from 6 feet away, about the same as a refrigerator’s levels—it was still pleasant enough that we didn’t mind. If you think it sounds silly to sacrifice some heating prowess for a pleasing retro aesthetic, then the VHEAT may not be the choice for you. But we found ourselves so utterly charmed by the plastic guitar-amp knobs and solid metal construction that we think this could be a fair trade-off for some people. If you absolutely need to have an electric heater in the bathroom (or somewhere else where it can get wet), the Lasko CD08200 is the only one we’d recommend to do the job safely. The idea of placing high-voltage electrical equipment where it can get wet is generally frowned upon. But if you’re truly tired of facing freezing bathroom tiles when you step out of the shower in the morning, the 1500-watt Lasko CD08200 bathroom heater is the best way to warm your water closet while mitigating the risk. With just one easy-to-find button and a default 1-hour heating mode, the Lasko is one the fastest-acting heaters we’ve tested, with the right electrical protections to keep your bathroom both snug, and safe. The CD08200 has a similar design to our longstanding Lasko budget pick, but with a thicker, more cube-like shape rather than a tall thin rectangle. It’s also surprisingly simpler to control than the other Lasko, with just one large circular button on the top of the unit. It’s literally the only thing you need to hit, which is good, because you can’t miss it. This button cycles the heater through three settings: a 1-hour timer mode, always-on high mode (1500 watts), and always-on low (750 watts). The delightful uncomplicated user experience here is that you walk into the bathroom, absently smack the top of the unit as you rub the sleep from your bleary eyes, then get right into the shower without being afraid to leave the warmth of running water once you’ve finished cleaning yourself. Even if you forget to turn it off again, the default 1-hour heating mode means it’ll shut itself off soon enough.  In our tests, the Lasko CD08200 managed to raise the temperature in the bathroom by an impressive 12 degrees over the course of just one hour. While it did leave the whole bathroom feeling warmer, we also measured about a ten degree difference on average between our sensor at three feet in front of the heater, and the one we placed six feet away on a diagonal. The Lasko CD08200 will definitely warm you up regardless of your bathroom layout — but if you can aim it directly at yourself (or where you’ll be emerging from the shower), we’d recommend it. As an added bonus, the Lasko also helped to noticeably reduce the humidity in the room, burning off most of the condensation that otherwise tends to form while you shower. Whereas most of the other heaters we tested only caused the humidity to drop by a few points, the Lasko CD08200 essentially traded one percentage point of humidity for every one point of heat. This might not be a boon in every situation, but it was a pleasant surprise in the windowless bathroom where we performed our tests, which otherwise has to rely on a single overhead fan for venting and dehumidification. Last but absolutely not least, the Lasko CD08200 is unique among our picks in that it’s equipped with an ALCI plug. This works in conjunction with a GFCI outlet (which you hopefully already have in your bathroom, if it’s up to code) in order to prevent the electrical current from going somewhere it shouldn’t — like, say, into a puddle of water. This is what specifically sets the Lasko apart for low-risk bathroom usage. The ALCI plug should sense if there’s an abundance of electrical heat — say, if you accidentally splash the heater while it’s plugged in and running — and then automatically cut off the current. The Lasko also has its own built-in overheat protection. That being said, it lacks the tip-over switch that’s included on most of our other space heater picks. In this case, we think that’s OK; it’s not very tall or likely to tip over, and if anything does go wrong, the ALCI plug should catch the problem before it turns into something worse.  Even though the Lasko has these important safety features, the instruction manual also makes it explicitly clear: “this product should never be used near water.” The manual doesn’t define “near,” but, point taken: Just because it’s safer in the case of an accident doesn’t mean you should willingly expose it to water. Unlike some outdoor patio heaters we recommend, the Lasko doesn’t even have an Ingress Protection rating for water resistance. Don’t even splash it, if you can avoid it. “Personal-size” space heaters, which max out at 750 watts—half of our typical power threshold for space heaters—have grown increasingly popular on Amazon in recent years. We’ve been hesitant to even try them, as the costs are rarely good enough to justify their efficiency. In 2020, we finally decided to make an exception for the desktop-size Vornado Velocity 1—which was fine, but mostly just justified our prior assumptions about personal-size space heaters. The Velocity 1 had tremendous warming power at 3 feet, raising the temperature by a whopping 16 degrees in just 20 minutes; but from 6 feet away, it only increased the temperature by 2 degrees. This was, by far, the worst heat distribution we’ve seen in our tests. While this might seem fine as a little brick of heat to aim at yourself in the office, it’s also the loudest model we’ve tested, with a sound like a model rocket that’s about to backfire and explode. If you want something cheap, you’re better off with our budget pick from Lasko—it’s quieter, and hotter, with better heat distribution, for the same price. Our former upgrade pick, the Dyson Hot+Cool Jet Focus AM09, was one of the most efficient space heaters we tested and also doubled as a cooling fan, making it a great option for year-round climate control. Sadly, it has been discontinued by the manufacturer. We also tested the AmazonBasics Portable Ceramic Tower Space Heater, shortly before the news broke that various AmazonBasics electronics products had been exploding with concerning frequency; by the time we were finished testing, it had already been discontinued. Fortunately, we didn’t experience any pyrotechnics ourselves. But we were disappointed with it in other ways, including its maddeningly confusing controls and the 15-degree temperature difference between our measurements at 3 and 6 feet. It was interesting that the AmazonBasics heater could be positioned as a tower, on its side like a log, and could point the heat upwards on an angle; unfortunately, this feature also meant it lacked a tip-over switch, which made it concerning to use even if it didn’t explode on us. We also tested the Portable Digital Radiator from AmazonBasics. It was cooler to touch than our current oil-filled radiator pick from De’Longhi, but that’s because it only raised the room temperature by 4 degrees after 2 hours. Disappointing performance and safety concerns make this a quick dismissal. For our 2020 tests, we also took a look at the De'Longhi HSX4315E Slim Style Digital Convection Panel Heater with Fan. These are a different style of heater than the ones we’ve previously tested, with floor- or wall-mounted capabilities that make them similar to the built-in electric radiators you might find in some homes; if you’ve ever seen or used a Rinnai, that’s probably a good comparison point. We’ve seen a lot of these convection-style panel heaters popping up in our research, so we wanted to see how well they hold up. This particular De’Longhi model looks nice and heated the room well enough, but we don’t think it’d be a good substitute for a Vornado or a Rinnai-style installation. The controls were also confusing—they look like toggle switches, but they’re not, so you find yourself instinctually trying to flip the switch instead of tapping the button to make anything happen, every single time. The Vornado MVH, our previous runner-up pick, is mechanically almost identical to our top pick for the best space heater, the VH200. In previous years, we found it was slower to warm the room in our tests, and that the case was hotter to the touch after an hour. In 2019, our test model overheated when it was only 82 degrees in the room. And though its built-in safety feature did switch off automatically, as it was supposed to, we weren’t able to get the MVH to work again after that. The indicator light would turn on, and the fan would run, but the MVH simply wouldn’t put out any heat. Some Amazon reviewers have reportedly encountered a similar problem, and even though the manufacturer has typically been responsive and helpful, we think you’re better off going with a more reliable Vornado pick. We tested the Vornado VH10, which is a glossier, newer generation of the VH200, but nothing set it apart from our less expensive top pick. It recorded similarly quiet decibel levels and performed just as well in heating our room. The VH10 offers a few other perks, such as a ledge to coil the cord around on the bottom of the heater, but we actually found this more annoying than helpful, because our cord kept falling under the heating unit and activating its tip-over switch. The VH10 also has only two temperature settings (the VH200 has three), and it has a concave dial, which we found much harder to manipulate than our picks’ raised dials. It’s still a decent option overall, if our other Vornado picks are unavailable. We previously recommended the Honeywell UberHeat Ceramic Heater HCE200W as an also-great pick. We still think it looks nice, and it usually works pretty well for a loud, cheap fireball, but there are better options out there without the same drawbacks—the most troubling of which have been reports of failures within the first few months, on top of the usual complaints of units arriving damaged or inoperable from the start. The Vornado Glide reminded us aesthetically of Prince Robot IV from the comic book Saga. Like Prince Robot IV, the Glide took a while to warm up, and it was just kind of fine overall, with decent but uneven heat and very basic functionality. Instead of a standard tip-over switch, the Glide relies on a level indicator inside the unit. This actually makes it easier to tip it halfway over or lean it on two legs, but please don’t because that makes it a safety concern (also like Prince Robot IV). At first glance, the De’Longhi Comfort Temp Full Room Radiant Heater looks like our oil-filled radiator pick (also from De’Longhi) with updated controls and without the protective case around it. In practice, however, it’s purely frustrating—this model is difficult to move around on the (clunky) wheels without tipping it over or burning yourself. It’s also confusingly designed, with Min and Med switches that somehow add up to Max power when they’re both flipped on, and a ComforTemp button for “ideal” settings, with no information about what that setting actually is. We had previously tested the oil-filled De’Longhi Silent System EW7707CM as well, but we found it also lacking in comparison with the TRD40615T. De’Longhi also makes a ceramic tower heater that we looked at, the TCH7915ER. It worked well enough in our tests, steadily building up 10 degrees of heat across the room over the course of an hour. It also has built-in settings for “Eco” mode and “Anti-freeze,” which could be good for keeping sparsely used parts of the house from getting too cold in the winter. However, the grille reached 240 degrees Fahrenheit after an hour (even as the plastic sides of the case remained at a cool 85 degrees). It also made an obnoxious high-pitched whirring sound, and the tip-over switch activated only when it was fully horizontal, which is hardly safe. Although most models with a digital display that we tested could get up to either 90 or 99 degrees Fahrenheit—practical restrictions, considering how the lights work on such a display—the Honeywell Slim Ceramic Tower Heater goes up to only 85. And in our tests, it didn’t change the room temperature, even though the grille reached a whopping 170 degrees. We also dismissed several models without testing them in 2020, including the Black+Decker BHDC500B46, the Brightown Handy Space Heater, the Vornado AIR Vortex Heat 2, the Moonflor Ceramic Space Heater, and the andily Space Heater. These models either had questionable (read: probably fake) reviews or were too weak to meet our power standards. In previous years’ tests, we dismissed the micathermic De’Longhi HMP1500; the oil-filled Pelonis NY1507-14A; the Lasko 5409 Oscillating Ceramic Heater, 5160 Digital Ceramic Tower Heater, and 6462 Full-Circle Warmth Ceramic Heater; Vornado’s VH202 and ATH1; the Dr Infrared Heater Portable Space Heater (a strange faux-fireplace); the De’Longhi HVY1030; the Honeywell HeatGenius Ceramic Heater HCE840B; and the Crane Digital Ceramic Tower Heater EE-8079. Space heaters come with a list of safe-operating instructions that most people would find surprisingly thorough, and there are a number of ways anyone could mistakenly use these machines incorrectly. Doing so can be dangerous, even with added safety features like overheat protection and tip-over kill switches. It’s worth looking through a heater’s instructions, just to be safe. The first way to prevent a fire is to never leave a space heater running in a room unattended. Instructions often mention not to sleep with one on overnight. If you have pets or kids that could knock the heater over or accidentally drape fabric over it, keep a very close eye on its operation. We personally don’t leave any space heater in a room or closet within reach of young kids, even if it’s unplugged. Since a heater is a 12-to-15-amp appliance drawing considerable current, the heater’s plug and cord, combined with some intuitive on/off switches, pose a major electrical hazard to any curious toddler. Most kids back away from heat, but very few would anticipate an electric shock. That high current is why you should never use an extension cord with a space heater. Many of the pictures you see in critical reviews claiming a space heater “caught on fire” appear to be from people overloading an extension cord by plugging a space heater into it. The instructions for every space heater we’ve ever seen warn against this. Don’t use a power strip, either—we’ve seen negative reviews complaining of a heater breaking and ruining a power strip in the process, but the thing is, most manufacturers state that you can’t use heaters in a power strip at all. There are a lot of other warnings most manuals tend to include: Basically, heater manufacturers tend to want you to use heaters on a bare floor with nothing else around them. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) recommends further precautions, such as keeping flammable materials like paint and matches far away. You should read your own heater’s manual for any specific warnings. In case you need them, here are the PDF instruction manuals for the Vornado VH200 (PDF), the Lasko 754200 (PDF), and the De’Longhi TRD40615T (PDF). We also found the AHAM’s illustrated heater installation tips to be helpful.

Learn more Wirecutter strives to be the most trusted product recommendation service on the internet. We obsessively test and report on thousands of items each year to recommend the best of everything. Our goal is to save you time and eliminate the stress of shopping, whether you’re looking for everyday gear or gifts for loved ones. We work with total editorial independence. That means nothing appears on the site as a recommendation unless our writers and editors have deemed it the best through our rigorous reporting and testing. Wirecutter was founded in September 2011 and acquired by The New York Times Company in October 2016. Our reviews take weeks or months of research and years of experience. In addition to relying on our own expertise, we gather interviews and data from the best sources around, including engineers, scientists, designers, and innumerable subject-matter experts, ranging from barbers to cat café staff (and residents) to cornhole champions. And we pore over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the things we’re assessing. In a world where overpriced, top-of-the-line models loaded with junk features are often seen as the gold standard, we aim to recommend high-quality things that warrant their price and don’t push extra features you’ll rarely use. Our process is often fascinating and fun (imagine creating an obstacle course for robot vacuums, say, or setting a room ablaze to test fireproof safes). And we apply our assiduous approach and next-level research skills to more than 1,000 product categories, including washing machines, TVs, artificial Christmas trees, bath towels, nonstick pans, soundbars, storage bins, office chairs, headlamps, sewing machines, mattresses, wine glasses, air purifiers, space heaters, treadmills, iPhone cases, Wi-Fi routers, carry-on suitcases, cloth face masks, and, yes, actual wire cutters. In everything we do, we endeavor to make finding the best stuff—and knowing what stuff isn’t worth buying—quick, easy, and transparent, so you can get on with living your life. These are the same things we choose for ourselves and recommend to our family and friends. If we recommend that you spend your hard-earned money on something, we take it as seriously as if our own money were on the line. If a reader chooses to buy a product we recommend as a result of our research, analysis, interviews, and testing, our work is often (but not always) supported through an affiliate commission from the retailer when the reader makes the purchase. There’s no incentive for us to pick inferior products or to respond to pressure from manufacturers—in fact, it’s quite the opposite. If a reader returns their purchase because they’re dissatisfied or the recommendation is bad, we make no affiliate commission. We think that’s a pretty fair system that keeps us committed to serving our readers first. And of course, our writers and editors are never made aware of or influenced by which companies have affiliate relationships with our business team. The most important thing to us is reader trust. If we were to recommend something due to bias or laziness, readers wouldn’t support our work. We also invite readers to fact-check our pieces, which carefully outline the time, logic, and energy we spent researching, interviewing experts, and testing gear. Often, this takes dozens—sometimes even hundreds—of hours. Each guide plainly lays out all the evidence for how we made our picks so you can judge for yourself.
