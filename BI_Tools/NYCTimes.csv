By Adam Liptak WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Friday allowed a challenge to a Texas abortion law that banned most abortions in the state after about six weeks to proceed, ruling that abortion providers in the state may sue some state officials in federal court despite the procedural hurdles imposed by the unusual structure of the law. But the Supreme Court refused to block the law in the meantime, saying that lower courts should consider the matter. The development was both a victory for and a disappointment to supporters of abortion rights, who had hoped that the justices would reverse course from a Sept. 1 ruling that had allowed the law to go into effect, causing clinics in the state to curtail performing the procedure and forcing many women seeking abortions to travel out of state. The decision in the Texas case came less than two weeks after the court heard a direct challenge to the right to abortion established in 1973 in Roe v. Wade, in a case about a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks. Roe prohibits states from banning abortion before fetal viability, the point at which fetuses can sustain life outside the womb, or about 23 to 24 weeks into a pregnancy. The court’s six-member conservative majority seemed prepared to uphold the Mississippi law, and several justices indicated that they would vote to overrule Roe outright. A decision in the case is not expected until late June. The Texas law flouts Roe’s viability line by barring abortions once fetal cardiac activity can be detected, usually around 6 weeks. The challenges to the Texas law focused not on the law’s constitutionality but on whether the law could be challenged in court by either abortion providers in the state or the federal government. The cases provided the court with an opportunity to revisit its earlier decision allowing the law to go into effect before the justices had grappled with its constitutionality or settled the question of how it could be challenged. The Texas law, known as Senate Bill 8, has unusual features. Usually, a lawsuit seeking to block a law because it is unconstitutional would name state officials as defendants. However, the Texas law, which makes no exceptions for pregnancies resulting from incest or rape, bars state officials from enforcing it and instead deputizes private individuals to sue anyone who performs the procedure or “aids and abets” it. The patient may not be sued, but doctors, staff members at clinics, counselors, people who help pay for the procedure or drive them to it are all potential defendants. Plaintiffs, who do not need to live in Texas, have any connection to the abortion or show any injury from it, are entitled to $10,000 and their legal fees recovered if they win. Prevailing defendants are not entitled to legal fees. The court’s earlier encounter with the law left the justices bitterly divided, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. joining the court’s three more liberal members in dissent. The majority opinion, issued just before midnight on Sept. 1, was unsigned and consisted of a single long paragraph. It said the abortion providers who had challenged the law in an emergency application had not made their case in the face of “complex and novel” procedural questions. The majority stressed that it was not ruling on the constitutionality of the Texas law and did not mean to limit “procedurally proper challenges” to it. Each of the dissenting justices issued an opinion in that earlier ruling. “The court’s order is stunning,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, for instance. “Presented with an application to enjoin a flagrantly unconstitutional law engineered to prohibit women from exercising their constitutional rights and evade judicial scrutiny, a majority of justices have opted to bury their heads in the sand.” “The court has rewarded the state’s effort to delay federal review of a plainly unconstitutional statute, enacted in disregard of the court’s precedents, through procedural entanglements of the state’s own creation,” Justice Sotomayor wrote. “The court should not be so content to ignore its constitutional obligations to protect not only the rights of women, but also the sanctity of its precedents and of the rule of law.” Mississippi abortion law. The court heard arguments in a challenge to a Mississippi law that bars most abortions after 15 weeks. The case could lead to the end of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. Texas abortion law. After the court let Texas effectively outlaw most abortions in a 5-4 decision, the justices heard arguments that could allow it to reverse course. The case puts Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the spotlight as the most likely member to switch sides. New York gun law. The justices will consider the constitutionality of a longstanding New York law that imposes strict limits on carrying guns in public. The court has not issued a major Second Amendment ruling in more than a decade. A test for Chief Justice Roberts. The highly charged docket will test the leadership of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who lost his position at the court’s ideological center with the arrival last fall of Justice Amy Coney Barrett. A drop in public support. Chief Justice Roberts now leads a court increasingly associated with partisanship. Recent polls show the court is suffering a distinct drop in public support following a spate of unusual late-night summer rulings in politically charged cases. The case returned to the Supreme Court on two separate tracks. After the court rejected the providers’ request for emergency relief, the Justice Department filed its own challenge to the law, one that it said was not subject to the procedural barriers the providers had faced. The case soon reached the Supreme Court on an emergency application. The abortion providers also returned to the court, asking the justices to use an unusual procedure — “certiorari before judgment” — to leapfrog the appeals court and decide whether they were entitled to sue. The Supreme Court agreed to decide both cases on Oct. 22, putting them on an extraordinarily fast track. It heard arguments just 10 days later, on Nov. 1, focusing on the question of whether the providers and the government were entitled to sue in light of the law’s unusual structure. At those arguments, two members of the original majority, Justices Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, asked questions suggesting that they might have had a change of heart about the law.

Abortion providers said they would expand services if the State Supreme Court upheld the ruling. Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By J. David Goodman HOUSTON — A state district court judge in Texas ruled on Thursday that the unique enforcement scheme of a restrictive abortion law violated the State Constitution by allowing any private citizen to sue abortion providers or others accused of breaking the law. In a 48-page opinion, Judge David Peeples found that the approach, which had been seen by anti-abortion groups as its greatest strength, unconstitutionally granted standing to those who were not injured, denied due process and represented an “unlawful delegation of enforcement power to a private person.” While deemed an important victory for abortion rights groups, abortion providers said on Thursday that they would not immediately resume performing the procedure after about six weeks of pregnancy. The decision came in response to a number of lawsuits brought in Texas state court by abortion providers and others against Texas Right to Life, an anti-abortion group that had lobbied for the law. The group immediately filed a notice of appeal on Thursday. “The abortion industry’s lawsuit abuses the judicial system and turns this court into a mere platform for airing criticisms against the boldest pro-life law to take effect since Roe v. Wade,” Kimberlyn Schwartz, a Texas Right to Life spokeswoman, said in a statement. The abortion law, known in Texas as Senate Bill 8 or the “heartbeat law,” prohibits abortions after cardiac activity has been detected, usually around six weeks of pregnancy. By expressly prohibiting state officials from enforcement, and relying instead on individuals, the law avoided the usual process of legal scrutiny and went into effect in September after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to step in. The Supreme Court heard arguments about the law last month as part of an expedited process and is expected to rule soon. The court has also been weighing arguments over a Mississippi law in a case seen as a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that prevented states from banning abortions before fetal viability. The Mississippi law bans the procedure after 15 weeks, or about two months before viability. In Texas, abortion providers have said they were abiding by the new law because of the threat of legal action from any individual against someone who performs or “aids and abets” the procedure, including clinic staff or even the person who provided transportation to the clinic. “We have said all along that in order to fully restore abortion access in Texas, we need a decision in the U.S. Supreme Court or the Texas Supreme Court,” said Julie Murray, a senior staff attorney at Planned Parenthood. “Today’s decision is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough relief for abortion providers.” In his opinion, Judge Peeples wrote that the Texas Legislature did not have a right under the state’s Constitution to allow people who had not suffered any injury from a violation of the abortion law to come into court and sue. He also found that the granting of awards of “no less than $10,000” to anyone successful in their suits violated the right to due process under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Judge Peeples wrote that the law’s mechanism of delegating enforcement power to private citizens, if found constitutional, could be applied to all manner of contentious issues, including guns, same-sex marriage, freedom of speech and climate change. “We are a diverse and creative people and it seems naïve to hope that these procedures will be cabined voluntarily,” he wrote. Abortion providers said that if the ruling were upheld by the State Supreme Court, they would again begin providing abortions beyond six weeks of pregnancy because the law could not be enforced. The number of abortions performed in Texas fell by roughly half in the weeks after the law went into effect, a fact that anti-abortion groups have credited to the law’s unique structure.

The rising costs spell trouble for officials at the Federal Reserve and the White House, who are trying to calibrate policy at a moment when the labor market has yet to completely heal from the pandemic, but the risk that price increases could become more lasting is increasing. The Consumer Price Index climbed by 6.8 percent in the year through November, the data showed, the fastest pace since 1982. After stripping out food and fuel, which can move around a lot from month to month, inflation climbed by 4.9 percent. Prices were up 0.8 percent from October, according to the report. That’s slightly slower than the prior monthly increase, but still an unusually rapid pace. The question is what happens next. Fed officials have become increasingly concerned about rising price — both because the uptick has lasted longer than expected and because it shows signs of broadening to areas less affected by the pandemic. Earlier this year, prices increases were concentrated in goods. Used cars and couches were in demand as the pandemic changed people’s lifestyles, but factories around the world struggled to keep up with the surge in buying, in part because shutdowns tied to the virus upended production. Shipping routes and ports also became clogged as demand followed an atypical pattern, with too many U.S.-bound goods trying to leave Asia in particular. Those disruptions were expected to be temporary. Instead, they have lasted for months, as demand for goods remains strong and because the virus continues to upend production. As pandemic quirks persist, inflationary pressures are also broadening. That includes rental prices, which have surged after an initial slackening during the pandemic and are helping to push up overall price gains. It’s a worrying development for the Fed as it considers its next policy steps. “Generally, the higher prices we’re seeing are related to the supply-and-demand imbalances that can be traced directly back to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, but it’s also the case that price increases have spread much more broadly in the recent few months,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during congressional testimony late last month. “I think the risk of higher inflation has increased.” Fed officials are closely watching what happens with wages — and with consumer inflation expectations — as they try to gauge when and how much inflation will fade. But they are also starting to acknowledge that they might have to react to rising prices. Mr. Powell signaled last week that the Fed, which began cutting back on economic support last month, will discuss speeding up that process at its Dec. 14-15 meeting. Economists expect central bankers to announce a plan to slow down their monthly bond purchases fast enough so that the program ends several months earlier, putting Fed officials in a position to raise their benchmark interest rate, their more traditional and more powerful tool. Friday’s data will keep policymakers on track to accelerate their plans to taper off bond purchases, said Alan Detmeister, a senior economist at UBS and former chief of the wages and prices division at the Fed Board in Washington. “This is still an enormous — a very, very strong — number,” Mr. Detmeister said, explaining that while he expects inflation to moderate, it may take until the middle of next year for that to show up clearly in the year-over-year data. “It seems pretty clear that they’re going to speed up the taper,” he added. Moving to the next step — raising rates — would make debt of all kinds, from mortgages to car and business loans, more expensive. That would likely slow spending and hiring, cooling off demand and weighing down buoyant housing costs. The combination could help to put a lid on price gains. But it could also leave the country with a less competitive labor market. That could be bad if the millions of people who remain out of the labor market compared to before the pandemic — many of them because of child-care issues and other virus-tied concerns — decide to embark on a job hunt. Even so, the Fed is wary of letting inflation rocket out of control. In the 1960s, the central bank failed to take sufficiently decisive action to tamp down rising prices. Inflation leapt out of control, rising to double-digit levels during the 1970s, and Paul Volcker, then the Fed chair, pushed interest rates up sharply to get things under control in the early 1980s. The hit to demand caused a painful recession before it brought price gains to heel. The mistake, and its aftermath, has haunted central bankers’s nightmares ever since. As housing and other day-to-day costs rise, workers may begin to ask for raises to help offset the financial blow. Employers are competing for laborers at a time when job openings far exceed the number of people actively looking for jobs, and wages are rising at a brisk pace. The Employment Cost Index, a measure the Fed watches closely, picked up notably in the three-month period that ended in September. Increased pay has not been enough to fully offset inflation for most people: Wage gains are up sharply, especially for low earners, but are not rising quickly enough to keep up with the acceleration in prices. And as companies that face rising input and labor costs seek to pass those on to consumers, it may actually help to keep prices rising. Big companies are managing to remain profitable as parts from overseas and commodities like gas climb in price, in part because they are successfully handing off those costs to consumers. Profit margins for nonfinancial companies have been increasing at a brisk pace this year, including in some of the industries hardest-hit by supply problems. “Inventories of automobiles continued to shrink, but dealers saw strong profits because of high prices of vehicles,” the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a collection of regional economic reports, noted from the Richmond district. By Madeleine Ngo  A jump in inflation in November was partly fueled by rising prices for food and rent, which have increasingly posed a challenge for consumers and policymakers in Washington. A Labor Department report released on Friday showed that inflation jumped to the highest level in nearly 40 years, climbing by 6.8 percent in the year through November. The big number included a strong increase in food prices, which rose 6.1 percent from a year earlier, according to the Consumer Price Index report. The 0.7 increase in November came on the heels of several months of strong gains: The food index climbed 0.9 percent in October and September. Rent also rose 0.4 percent last month, reflecting a tight housing market that is feeding into inflation. The surge in rent costs has stemmed from strong demand for owned homes and as people have searched for extra space but found that houses were in short supply. The rise in prices puts pressure on the Federal Reserve, which is discussing whether to end its bond-buying program faster. That would put it in a position to start to lift interest rates, which the central bank has held at near zero since the beginning of the pandemic. Inflation has continued to surge as supply chain disruptions, strong demand for goods and rising wages have pushed prices higher, complicating President Biden’s agenda and depressing his approval ratings. Americans have felt the increase in prices, which has dented their finances and forced them to cut back in other ways. Consumers have grown more wary of the jump in costs, expressing less optimism about their personal finances and the overall growth of the economy, according to a recent University of Michigan survey. Alan Detmeister, a senior economist at UBS who used to be chief of the wages and prices division at the Fed Board in Washington, said that rents would continue to move up substantially in the near term. But real-time trackers like Apartment List have showed some softening in recent readings, which could be a good sign that those pressures will cool off toward the middle of 2022. “While we’re probably going to be seeing some strong rents for the near term, those are probably going to be slowing,” Mr. Detmeister said. Jayson Lusk, an agricultural economist at Purdue University, said that food prices had increased as people’s savings rose during the pandemic. That has given them the ability to pay more, making them more willing to accept price increases. Companies in the food industry have also increased wages to attract more workers, and have tried to pass along those costs. Dirk Van de Put, the chief executive of Mondelez International, told CNBC last month that the company — which makes Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and Sour Patch Kids candy — expected to increase prices by 7 percent next year. The company has faced higher costs for commodities, packaging and transportation, he said. “It is very difficult to keep our clients well-stocked,” he said. “Our on shelf availability is nowhere near where we would like it to be.” Although millions of people have seen their savings grow, that has started to dwindle for many working- and middle-class households. Higher food costs have a disproportionate impact on lower-income people, who tend to spend more of their income on food, Mr. Lusk said. Diana Madoshi, a retired nurse in Placer County, Calif., who relies on Social Security benefits, said that higher prices at the grocery store had started to burden her budget. A carton of eggs, which used to cost about $2.80 before the pandemic, now can cost nearly $4, she said. To offset the amount she is paying for food, Ms. Madoshi said she had been taking fewer Uber rides to her doctor appointments, instead having her friends drive her. She said she had also cut back the amount of clothes she had been buying during the pandemic. “This is just another harsh reality of what we’re going through right now,” said Ms. Madoshi, 75. “And there’s nothing I can do about that.” By Talmon Joseph Smith  Inflation’s surge in the United States has been driven in part by a substantial increase in energy and prices over the last year, although there has been some moderation in recent weeks. According to the Consumer Price Index, the 12-month change in energy prices as of November was 33.3 percent, nearly five times the overall inflation rate. The cost for gasoline moved higher by 6.1 percent last month — a burden for households, particularly as the holiday travel season begins — and by 58.1 percent in the last year. Prices for fuel oil — which is used for industrial and home heating — rose 3.5 percent last month, though that rate was far tamer than October’s 12.3 percent increase. If that easing continues, it may provide some measure of relief for households bracing for crippling household winter heating bills, but fuel oil is still up 59.3 percent on a yearly basis. In better news, electricity prices were up a more modest 0.3 percent last month — a break from October’s 1.8 percent increase, but still 6.5 percent higherthan a year earlier. Unlike in some other commodity sectors, increased energy prices in the market are quickly passed through to consumers, who have become accustomed to cheaper energy prices in recent years and now find themselves rankled by the sudden pressure put on their budgets. “Households are facing higher prices at every turn,” said Greg McBride, the chief financial analyst at Bankrate, a personal finance company. The recent jumps in energy, food and shelter, he said, “are putting a major squeeze on household budgets.” Those three expenses account for more than half of the weighting in the Consumer Price Index. Energy alone accounts for 7.5 percent. Because energy and food prices are notoriously volatile, the government reports separate inflation figures, including and excluding those categories. Including all categories, the one-month rise in November was 6.8 percent; without food and energy, it was 4.9 percent. The surge in consumer prices is likely to intensify debates in Washington over the continuation of uncomfortably high inflation numbers — especially for core expenses such as energy that households can’t go without — and how policymakers can address them. Republicans in Congress and lobbying groups for the oil and gas industry have filleted the Biden White House for higher energy prices; however, nonpartisan industry researchers have noted the overall weak relationship between a given administration’s level of support for renewable fuels and the arc of fossil fuel prices. The George W. Bush administration, for instance, was noted for its connections to the oil and gas industry, yet during Mr. Bush’s second term, energy prices were often higher than today. And the Obama administration — whose clean-energy initiatives were prominent — benefited from a private-sector fracking boom on its watch, which increased supply and made gas and home heating relatively cheap for years. Good news about energy prices has been uncommon for consumers lately. But recent moves in the market have indicated that the weather may cut them at least a temporary break. Natural gas, used to heat almost half of U.S. households, almost doubled in price earlier this fall, but sank by more than 10 percent at one point this week after the release of government weather forecasts projecting a warmer-than-expected winter. Several states have had some of their warmest December days on record. And according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center, above-average temperatures throughout the South and most of the East could predominate for most of this winter. “If it’s a warmer winter, then our estimates about consumption will be down, and if consumption is down, that’ll reduce the price of the fuel,” said Mark Wolfe, the executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association, a group of state officials that provide assistance to households in need. “It’s a good sign.” Much like retail businesses, energy producers have had to wrestle with imbalances in the economy caused by the pandemic shock and a halting reopening of activity. An analysis this month from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas noted that oil-field activity in the region had risen steadily over the last month and a half, but that “supply-chain delays worsened, with significantly larger backlogs, escalating costs, and material and equipment lead times as long as 10 months for some types of machinery.” By Jim Tankersley  The Labor Department’s announcement on Friday that the Consumer Price Index rose 0.8 percent in November and 6.8 percent from the year before is the latest sign of rapid price increases eroding President Biden’s approval ratings on the economy and threatening the expansive economic and climate legislation he is trying to push through Congress by the end of the year. Voters and a crucial Democrat in the Senate, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, have become increasingly concerned with the rising inflation that now ranks as America’s fastest annual price growth in four decades. A string of recent polls show inflation now ranks as the top economic concern nationwide, a product of rising costs for gasoline, food and a variety of goods that Americans have bought in droves as the country emerges from the pandemic recession. Mr. Manchin is a centrist who looms as the most likely Democrat to vote against Mr. Biden’s $2.2 trillion legislation, which the president is trying to pass along party lines, given Republicans have no intention of voting for the bill. Mr. Biden will need every Democrat in the Senate to support the measure for it to pass. Mr. Manchin has in recent days repeated his fear that the spending in the bill, which includes initiatives to fight climate change and invest in children, parents and workers, could exacerbate price increases further — a claim that administration officials and Mr. Biden say is unfounded. The president has attempted in recent weeks to balance his efforts to cast the recovery as strong — citing job gains, falling unemployment claims, nominal wage growth and the fastest economic growth since the mid-1980s — with acknowledgment that inflation has hurt American families’ wallets. And he has stressed the actions his administration has taken to unclog supply chains that are contributing to price increases. In a statement on Friday, Mr. Biden said the data did not reflect more recent trends, which he said showed prices moving down for cars and gasoline, among others. “Today’s numbers reflect the pressures that economies around the world are facing as we emerge from a global pandemic — prices are rising,” he said. “But developments in the weeks after these data were collected last month show that price and cost increase are slowing, although not as quickly as we’d like.” “Even with this progress,” Mr. Biden added, “price increases continue to squeeze family budgets. We are making progress on pandemic-related challenges to our supply chain which make it more expensive to get goods on shelves, and I expect more progress on that in the weeks ahead.” Mr. Biden’s aides have said throughout the year that the expect the current bout of inflation to fade quickly, as supply chain issues work themselves out and the world continues to emerge from the pandemic. Those predictions have frequently proven overly optimistic. But administration officials made another round of them this week ahead of the Labor Department release, saying they expected the drivers of inflation, like rising prices for used cars, to prove temporary and the rate of inflation to fall sharply in the first half of 2022. Administration officials also say they already see signs that other main drivers of price increases, like gasoline, are cooling off. Energy prices were up 33 percent from a year ago in the November report, and gasoline prices were up 58 percent. But the cost of a gallon at the pump began to fall in recent weeks, and so has the cost of natural gas. Republican lawmakers on Friday continued to point fingers at Mr. Biden for the rising costs and said Democrats would exacerbate inflation with their $2.2 trillion spending bill. “Senate Democrats should suspend any consideration of Biden’s inflation-driving Build Back Better spending binge until the president can demonstrate he can get inflation under control,” Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and ranking member on the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement. By Coral Murphy Marcos  S&P 500 - % Dow - % Nasdaq - % As of  Data delayed at least 15 minutes Source: FactSet Stocks on Wall Street jumped on Friday, with the S&P 500 on track for its best week since February, after inflation report that showed consumer prices were rising fast but was nevertheless in line with economists expectations. The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent in early trading, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1 percent. The S&P 500 has been rebounding this week, as concerns about the Omicron variant of the coronavirus eased somewhat even as it continues to spread. The benchmark index is poised to close the week with a gain of about 3 percent, within striking distance of a record.The gains on Friday came despite a Labor Department report that showed the Consumer Price Index rose at the fastest pace in nearly 40 years, up by 6.8 percent last month compared with a year earlier. The inflation measure rose 0.8 percent from October, which is a slightly slower rate in month-to-month increases. Officials at the Federal Reserve officials have been watching inflation data closely for the past several months, and signaled that the bank was ready to speed up its pullback on monetary policy stimulus that had helped support the economy since the pandemic started. The latest data adds to concerns that what was initially a burst of reopening-driven inflation could linger longer than policymakers first expected.Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, has said he expects central bank officials to address slowing bond purchases faster when they meet next week. Officials announced plans to slow those purchases by $15 billion a month, which would have the program ending midway through 2022. Ending those purchases would set the stage for interest rate increases, the Fed’s most powerful tool to cool down the economy. By Emma Goldberg  Better.com’s mercurial chief executive, Vishal Garg, faced swift backlash for his decision to fire more than 900 employees on a Zoom call last week. The mortgage lender’s board announced in a memo sent to staff on Friday that Mr. Garg was “taking time off” after the “very regrettable events.” “I come to you with not great news,” Mr. Garg had said to about 9 percent of his staff, in a recording since shared widely online. “If you’re on this call you are part of the unlucky group that is being laid off. Your employment here is terminated effective immediately.” Better.com, which is backed by SoftBank, has brought on a third-party firm to assess its leadership and culture, according to a copy of the board’s memo obtained by The New York Times. Several top employees resigned following the firings, two in communications and one in marketing. Better.com did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Christian Chapman, 41, a former underwriting trainer at Better.com, said he was used to preparing for company meetings by making sure his children weren’t around, because Mr. Garg tended to use foul language. But last Wednesday, when he received an unexpected invitation to the company call with Mr. Garg, he got a sense of foreboding because the chief executive looked so solemn. As Mr. Garg impassively delivered the news, Mr. Chapman said his “gut dropped to the floor,” and he tried to message teammates to ask what was happening but his computer access was shut off almost immediately. “I’ve been through layoffs and usually there’s closure because you talk to H.R., you go to your desk and grab your personal belongings and say goodbyes,” Mr. Chapman said. “There’s no closure here. You’re staring at an empty screen in your house.” It took about three hours for him to receive a follow-up email, reviewed by The Times, that explained the terms of the termination, Mr. Chapman added. On Thursday, the company increased his termination package from one to two months of pay. He also received a Christmas package containing a trophy, certificate and company T-shirt (which his wife offered to burn). Mr. Chapman said that the chief executive’s messaging about fired employees “stealing” from the company by working only two hours a day — which the former employee said was contradicted by his team’s recent promotions and raises — had made it challenging for them to apply for new jobs. Mr. Garg has apologized for his behavior on the Zoom call. In a memo dated Tuesday that was posted on the company’s site, Mr. Garg said he owned the choice to make layoffs but had “blundered” the approach. By Stanley Reed  An oil project off the coast of Scotland that had become a test of Britain’s environmental credentials was shelved by its main owner on Friday. The decision to halt Cambo, as the oil field is known, is a huge win for environmental groups like Greenpeace, and a blow to the North Sea oil industry. It comes just over a week after Shell, which owns 30 percent of the project, pulled out of the investment. “We are pausing the development while we evaluate next steps,” said Siccar Point Energy, a London-based company that is backed by private equity firms, including Blackstone, the financial management giant. Siccar Point said it had planned to invest $2.6 billion in Cambo, and had already spent $190 million on the field since acquiring it in 2017. The firm said that developing Cambo, a potentially valuable source of oil and natural gas, would have created 1,000 jobs. Environmental groups, on the other hand, said that starting new drilling projects was not compatible with Britain’s goals on tackling climate change and reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The British government has been considering whether to let Cambo go ahead. Located northwest of Scotland’s Shetland Islands, Cambo became a target of protests, including at the recent United Nations climate summit in Glasgow. Scotland’s top politician, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, has said she did not think it should be given a green light. On Dec. 2, Shell said it would not go ahead with investment because the economic case was not strong enough. Shell’s decision, which was also prompted by the potential for delays from protests and lawsuits, led Siccar Point to decide it could not “progress on the originally planned time scale,” the firm said. By Stephen Gandel  The U.S. stock market has been on a run, with the S&P 500 up nearly 4 percent so far this week, and more than 25 percent for the year. Fears about the Omicron variant of the coronavirus quickly faded, with stocks regaining lost ground. This makes some market watchers nervous, the DealBook newsletter reports, because of a metric that suggests that stock prices may be too high given the level of corporate earnings and rising inflation. The S&P 500 now has a real earnings yield — the inflation-adjusted ratio of earnings per share to the stock price — approaching negative 3 percent, the lowest since 1947, Bank of America equity strategists led by Savita Subramanian wrote in a recent note to clients. Negative yields are rare and often precede a stock market slump, the analysts wrote. A low earnings yield means that corporate profits are not keeping up with stock prices. And because real yields subtract inflation from the measure, a negative real earnings yield means that a company, based on its stock price, is not generating enough profits to keep up with rising prices. (Using October’s inflation number, Tesla’s real earnings yield is negative 5.2 percent.) The last time the S&P 500 had a negative real earnings yield, the Bank of America analysts said, was in 2000, before the tech bubble burst. It also happened twice during the stagflation of the 1970s and ’80s. This year, the S&P 500’s real earnings yield turned negative months ago, but it really sank recently as inflation has marched higher. Besides a bear market, there are two ways a negative earnings yield can turn positive: First, inflation would have to drop significantly, which some economists think is possible. Second, at a time when wages are rising and supply issues are interfering with plans, corporate profits could accelerate faster than expected. After the initial shock of the pandemic, stocks have shrugged off negative news and set a series of records. But the more that analysts consider the numbers, the more they worry that the gravity-defying rise may not last much longer. (Stocks fell on Thursday.) That said, “we live in a world where real negative rates are almost acceptable as a norm,” Ms. Subramanian noted. By Michael J. de la Merced  The Securities and Exchange Commission’s chair, Gary Gensler, has made clear for months that he is worried about the risks faced by investors in special purpose acquisition companies, which over the past two years have become a hugely popular way to take businesses public. In a speech on Thursday, he elaborated on one of the S.E.C.’s main focuses in reducing those risks — with measures that could shake up the industry, the DealBook newsletter reports. Mr. Gensler noted that SPACs are allowed to pitch potential investors using forward-looking business data that isn’t allowed in initial public offerings. That loophole, he said, allows the financiers behind these funds to release rosy-looking numbers that mask the underlying health of the business they’re taking public. (The S.E.C. has been looking into disclosure issues in SPAC deals involving the likes of Nikola and Lucid.) It now looks as if the S.E.C. may require SPACs to provide more complete disclosures about their deals, and to do so earlier: “It is essential that investors receive the information they need, when they need it, without misleading hype,” Mr. Gensler said. He also suggested that the people behind SPACs, including their sponsors, financial advisers and accountants, should be held more accountable for their due diligence on the companies these funds acquire, much as underwriters of I.P.O.s are. “Make no mistake: When it comes to liability, SPACs do not provide a ‘free pass’ for gatekeepers,” he said in his speech. The goal is to even out the playing field between SPACs and I.P.O.s. Deal makers have expected financial regulators to tighten the rules governing blank-check funds, amid an explosion in their popularity and the underperformance of many companies that have used them to go public, but Mr. Gensler’s comments shed further light on what that might look like. By Jack Ewing  Daimler’s car and truck divisions concluded an amicable divorce on Friday when shares in Daimler Truck began trading separately on the Frankfurt stock exchange. The separation of Mercedes-Benz, the luxury carmaker, from Daimler Truck, which owns Freightliner in the United States, signaled the end of an era not only for Daimler but also the German economy. The spinoff, announced in February, was the final chapter in a transition that began in the 1990s, when Daimler was a sprawling conglomerate that also made trains and passenger aircraft. Along with other industrial empires like Siemens, Daimler has been forced to jettison excess baggage to remain competitive. For car and truck makers, the need to ditch unwieldy corporate structures has become even more urgent as they try to survive the shift to emission-free propulsion. One justification for the spinoff is that it will allow Daimler Truck’s managers to make decisions more quickly. Daimler Truck is betting on hydrogen fuel cells for long-haul trucks, in contrast to competitors like Scania that favor batteries. It is not yet clear which technology will prevail. A few decades ago, many German companies operated on the principle that bigger was better. That might have made sense when capital was harder to come by, said Martin Daum, the chief executive of Daimler Truck, because the more profitable parts of a conglomerate could generate cash for struggling units. “We had globally very inefficient capital markets,” Mr. Daum said in an interview. “That supported the buildup of conglomerates.” “Today, every business that has a compelling idea can raise money,” he said. Whether Daimler Truck has compelling ideas will now be put to the test. The shares opened Friday at 28 euros (about $31.60) and rose as much as 8.5 percent, valuing the company at about $27 billion. The new company is the largest truck maker in the United States by way of its Freightliner brand. Globally, Daimler Truck is also the largest maker of buses. Its other brands include Mercedes-Benz trucks and buses sold primarily in Europe and Fuso trucks sold in Asia. Daimler Truck and Mercedes-Benz luxury cars will remain closely connected. Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes, will retain a 35 percent stake in Daimler Truck. The remaining shares will be distributed to Daimler shareholders. BNP Paribas, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs are serving as listing agents for the spinoff."

The rising costs spell trouble for officials at the Federal Reserve and the White House, who are trying to calibrate policy at a moment when the labor market has yet to completely heal from the pandemic, but the risk that price increases could become more lasting is increasing. The Consumer Price Index climbed by 6.8 percent in the year through November, the data showed, the fastest pace since 1982. After stripping out food and fuel, which can move around a lot from month to month, inflation climbed by 4.9 percent. Prices were up 0.8 percent from October, according to the report. That’s slightly slower than the prior monthly increase, but still an unusually rapid pace. The question is what happens next. Fed officials have become increasingly concerned about rising price — both because the uptick has lasted longer than expected and because it shows signs of broadening to areas less affected by the pandemic. Earlier this year, prices increases were concentrated in goods. Used cars and couches were in demand as the pandemic changed people’s lifestyles, but factories around the world struggled to keep up with the surge in buying, in part because shutdowns tied to the virus upended production. Shipping routes and ports also became clogged as demand followed an atypical pattern, with too many U.S.-bound goods trying to leave Asia in particular. Those disruptions were expected to be temporary. Instead, they have lasted for months, as demand for goods remains strong and because the virus continues to upend production. As pandemic quirks persist, inflationary pressures are also broadening. That includes rental prices, which have surged after an initial slackening during the pandemic and are helping to push up overall price gains. It’s a worrying development for the Fed as it considers its next policy steps. “Generally, the higher prices we’re seeing are related to the supply-and-demand imbalances that can be traced directly back to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, but it’s also the case that price increases have spread much more broadly in the recent few months,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during congressional testimony late last month. “I think the risk of higher inflation has increased.” Fed officials are closely watching what happens with wages — and with consumer inflation expectations — as they try to gauge when and how much inflation will fade. But they are also starting to acknowledge that they might have to react to rising prices. Mr. Powell signaled last week that the Fed, which began cutting back on economic support last month, will discuss speeding up that process at its Dec. 14-15 meeting. Economists expect central bankers to announce a plan to slow down their monthly bond purchases fast enough so that the program ends several months earlier, putting Fed officials in a position to raise their benchmark interest rate, their more traditional and more powerful tool. Friday’s data will keep policymakers on track to accelerate their plans to taper off bond purchases, said Alan Detmeister, a senior economist at UBS and former chief of the wages and prices division at the Fed Board in Washington. “This is still an enormous — a very, very strong — number,” Mr. Detmeister said, explaining that while he expects inflation to moderate, it may take until the middle of next year for that to show up clearly in the year-over-year data. “It seems pretty clear that they’re going to speed up the taper,” he added. Moving to the next step — raising rates — would make debt of all kinds, from mortgages to car and business loans, more expensive. That would likely slow spending and hiring, cooling off demand and weighing down buoyant housing costs. The combination could help to put a lid on price gains. But it could also leave the country with a less competitive labor market. That could be bad if the millions of people who remain out of the labor market compared to before the pandemic — many of them because of child-care issues and other virus-tied concerns — decide to embark on a job hunt. Even so, the Fed is wary of letting inflation rocket out of control. In the 1960s, the central bank failed to take sufficiently decisive action to tamp down rising prices. Inflation leapt out of control, rising to double-digit levels during the 1970s, and Paul Volcker, then the Fed chair, pushed interest rates up sharply to get things under control in the early 1980s. The hit to demand caused a painful recession before it brought price gains to heel. The mistake, and its aftermath, has haunted central bankers’s nightmares ever since. As housing and other day-to-day costs rise, workers may begin to ask for raises to help offset the financial blow. Employers are competing for laborers at a time when job openings far exceed the number of people actively looking for jobs, and wages are rising at a brisk pace. The Employment Cost Index, a measure the Fed watches closely, picked up notably in the three-month period that ended in September. Increased pay has not been enough to fully offset inflation for most people: Wage gains are up sharply, especially for low earners, but are not rising quickly enough to keep up with the acceleration in prices. And as companies that face rising input and labor costs seek to pass those on to consumers, it may actually help to keep prices rising. Big companies are managing to remain profitable as parts from overseas and commodities like gas climb in price, in part because they are successfully handing off those costs to consumers. Profit margins for nonfinancial companies have been increasing at a brisk pace this year, including in some of the industries hardest-hit by supply problems. “Inventories of automobiles continued to shrink, but dealers saw strong profits because of high prices of vehicles,” the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a collection of regional economic reports, noted from the Richmond district. By Madeleine Ngo  A jump in inflation in November was partly fueled by rising prices for food and rent, which have increasingly posed a challenge for consumers and policymakers in Washington. A Labor Department report released on Friday showed that inflation jumped to the highest level in nearly 40 years, climbing by 6.8 percent in the year through November. The big number included a strong increase in food prices, which rose 6.1 percent from a year earlier, according to the Consumer Price Index report. The 0.7 increase in November came on the heels of several months of strong gains: The food index climbed 0.9 percent in October and September. Rent also rose 0.4 percent last month, reflecting a tight housing market that is feeding into inflation. The surge in rent costs has stemmed from strong demand for owned homes and as people have searched for extra space but found that houses were in short supply. The rise in prices puts pressure on the Federal Reserve, which is discussing whether to end its bond-buying program faster. That would put it in a position to start to lift interest rates, which the central bank has held at near zero since the beginning of the pandemic. Inflation has continued to surge as supply chain disruptions, strong demand for goods and rising wages have pushed prices higher, complicating President Biden’s agenda and depressing his approval ratings. Americans have felt the increase in prices, which has dented their finances and forced them to cut back in other ways. Consumers have grown more wary of the jump in costs, expressing less optimism about their personal finances and the overall growth of the economy, according to a recent University of Michigan survey. Alan Detmeister, a senior economist at UBS who used to be chief of the wages and prices division at the Fed Board in Washington, said that rents would continue to move up substantially in the near term. But real-time trackers like Apartment List have showed some softening in recent readings, which could be a good sign that those pressures will cool off toward the middle of 2022. “While we’re probably going to be seeing some strong rents for the near term, those are probably going to be slowing,” Mr. Detmeister said. Jayson Lusk, an agricultural economist at Purdue University, said that food prices had increased as people’s savings rose during the pandemic. That has given them the ability to pay more, making them more willing to accept price increases. Companies in the food industry have also increased wages to attract more workers, and have tried to pass along those costs. Dirk Van de Put, the chief executive of Mondelez International, told CNBC last month that the company — which makes Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and Sour Patch Kids candy — expected to increase prices by 7 percent next year. The company has faced higher costs for commodities, packaging and transportation, he said. “It is very difficult to keep our clients well-stocked,” he said. “Our on shelf availability is nowhere near where we would like it to be.” Although millions of people have seen their savings grow, that has started to dwindle for many working- and middle-class households. Higher food costs have a disproportionate impact on lower-income people, who tend to spend more of their income on food, Mr. Lusk said. Diana Madoshi, a retired nurse in Placer County, Calif., who relies on Social Security benefits, said that higher prices at the grocery store had started to burden her budget. A carton of eggs, which used to cost about $2.80 before the pandemic, now can cost nearly $4, she said. To offset the amount she is paying for food, Ms. Madoshi said she had been taking fewer Uber rides to her doctor appointments, instead having her friends drive her. She said she had also cut back the amount of clothes she had been buying during the pandemic. “This is just another harsh reality of what we’re going through right now,” said Ms. Madoshi, 75. “And there’s nothing I can do about that.” By Talmon Joseph Smith  Inflation’s surge in the United States has been driven in part by a substantial increase in energy and prices over the last year, although there has been some moderation in recent weeks. According to the Consumer Price Index, the 12-month change in energy prices as of November was 33.3 percent, nearly five times the overall inflation rate. The cost for gasoline moved higher by 6.1 percent last month — a burden for households, particularly as the holiday travel season begins — and by 58.1 percent in the last year. Prices for fuel oil — which is used for industrial and home heating — rose 3.5 percent last month, though that rate was far tamer than October’s 12.3 percent increase. If that easing continues, it may provide some measure of relief for households bracing for crippling household winter heating bills, but fuel oil is still up 59.3 percent on a yearly basis. In better news, electricity prices were up a more modest 0.3 percent last month — a break from October’s 1.8 percent increase, but still 6.5 percent higherthan a year earlier. Unlike in some other commodity sectors, increased energy prices in the market are quickly passed through to consumers, who have become accustomed to cheaper energy prices in recent years and now find themselves rankled by the sudden pressure put on their budgets. “Households are facing higher prices at every turn,” said Greg McBride, the chief financial analyst at Bankrate, a personal finance company. The recent jumps in energy, food and shelter, he said, “are putting a major squeeze on household budgets.” Those three expenses account for more than half of the weighting in the Consumer Price Index. Energy alone accounts for 7.5 percent. Because energy and food prices are notoriously volatile, the government reports separate inflation figures, including and excluding those categories. Including all categories, the one-month rise in November was 6.8 percent; without food and energy, it was 4.9 percent. The surge in consumer prices is likely to intensify debates in Washington over the continuation of uncomfortably high inflation numbers — especially for core expenses such as energy that households can’t go without — and how policymakers can address them. Republicans in Congress and lobbying groups for the oil and gas industry have filleted the Biden White House for higher energy prices; however, nonpartisan industry researchers have noted the overall weak relationship between a given administration’s level of support for renewable fuels and the arc of fossil fuel prices. The George W. Bush administration, for instance, was noted for its connections to the oil and gas industry, yet during Mr. Bush’s second term, energy prices were often higher than today. And the Obama administration — whose clean-energy initiatives were prominent — benefited from a private-sector fracking boom on its watch, which increased supply and made gas and home heating relatively cheap for years. Good news about energy prices has been uncommon for consumers lately. But recent moves in the market have indicated that the weather may cut them at least a temporary break. Natural gas, used to heat almost half of U.S. households, almost doubled in price earlier this fall, but sank by more than 10 percent at one point this week after the release of government weather forecasts projecting a warmer-than-expected winter. Several states have had some of their warmest December days on record. And according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center, above-average temperatures throughout the South and most of the East could predominate for most of this winter. “If it’s a warmer winter, then our estimates about consumption will be down, and if consumption is down, that’ll reduce the price of the fuel,” said Mark Wolfe, the executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association, a group of state officials that provide assistance to households in need. “It’s a good sign.” Much like retail businesses, energy producers have had to wrestle with imbalances in the economy caused by the pandemic shock and a halting reopening of activity. An analysis this month from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas noted that oil-field activity in the region had risen steadily over the last month and a half, but that “supply-chain delays worsened, with significantly larger backlogs, escalating costs, and material and equipment lead times as long as 10 months for some types of machinery.” By Jim Tankersley  The Labor Department’s announcement on Friday that the Consumer Price Index rose 0.8 percent in November and 6.8 percent from the year before is the latest sign of rapid price increases eroding President Biden’s approval ratings on the economy and threatening the expansive economic and climate legislation he is trying to push through Congress by the end of the year. Voters and a crucial Democrat in the Senate, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, have become increasingly concerned with the rising inflation that now ranks as America’s fastest annual price growth in four decades. A string of recent polls show inflation now ranks as the top economic concern nationwide, a product of rising costs for gasoline, food and a variety of goods that Americans have bought in droves as the country emerges from the pandemic recession. Mr. Manchin is a centrist who looms as the most likely Democrat to vote against Mr. Biden’s $2.2 trillion legislation, which the president is trying to pass along party lines, given Republicans have no intention of voting for the bill. Mr. Biden will need every Democrat in the Senate to support the measure for it to pass. Mr. Manchin has in recent days repeated his fear that the spending in the bill, which includes initiatives to fight climate change and invest in children, parents and workers, could exacerbate price increases further — a claim that administration officials and Mr. Biden say is unfounded. The president has attempted in recent weeks to balance his efforts to cast the recovery as strong — citing job gains, falling unemployment claims, nominal wage growth and the fastest economic growth since the mid-1980s — with acknowledgment that inflation has hurt American families’ wallets. And he has stressed the actions his administration has taken to unclog supply chains that are contributing to price increases. In a statement on Friday, Mr. Biden said the data did not reflect more recent trends, which he said showed prices moving down for cars and gasoline, among others. “Today’s numbers reflect the pressures that economies around the world are facing as we emerge from a global pandemic — prices are rising,” he said. “But developments in the weeks after these data were collected last month show that price and cost increase are slowing, although not as quickly as we’d like.” “Even with this progress,” Mr. Biden added, “price increases continue to squeeze family budgets. We are making progress on pandemic-related challenges to our supply chain which make it more expensive to get goods on shelves, and I expect more progress on that in the weeks ahead.” Mr. Biden’s aides have said throughout the year that the expect the current bout of inflation to fade quickly, as supply chain issues work themselves out and the world continues to emerge from the pandemic. Those predictions have frequently proven overly optimistic. But administration officials made another round of them this week ahead of the Labor Department release, saying they expected the drivers of inflation, like rising prices for used cars, to prove temporary and the rate of inflation to fall sharply in the first half of 2022. Administration officials also say they already see signs that other main drivers of price increases, like gasoline, are cooling off. Energy prices were up 33 percent from a year ago in the November report, and gasoline prices were up 58 percent. But the cost of a gallon at the pump began to fall in recent weeks, and so has the cost of natural gas. Republican lawmakers on Friday continued to point fingers at Mr. Biden for the rising costs and said Democrats would exacerbate inflation with their $2.2 trillion spending bill. “Senate Democrats should suspend any consideration of Biden’s inflation-driving Build Back Better spending binge until the president can demonstrate he can get inflation under control,” Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and ranking member on the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement. By Coral Murphy Marcos  S&P 500 - % Dow - % Nasdaq - % As of  Data delayed at least 15 minutes Source: FactSet Stocks on Wall Street jumped on Friday, with the S&P 500 on track for its best week since February, after inflation report that showed consumer prices were rising fast but was nevertheless in line with economists expectations. The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent in early trading, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1 percent. The S&P 500 has been rebounding this week, as concerns about the Omicron variant of the coronavirus eased somewhat even as it continues to spread. The benchmark index is poised to close the week with a gain of about 3 percent, within striking distance of a record.The gains on Friday came despite a Labor Department report that showed the Consumer Price Index rose at the fastest pace in nearly 40 years, up by 6.8 percent last month compared with a year earlier. The inflation measure rose 0.8 percent from October, which is a slightly slower rate in month-to-month increases. Officials at the Federal Reserve officials have been watching inflation data closely for the past several months, and signaled that the bank was ready to speed up its pullback on monetary policy stimulus that had helped support the economy since the pandemic started. The latest data adds to concerns that what was initially a burst of reopening-driven inflation could linger longer than policymakers first expected.Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, has said he expects central bank officials to address slowing bond purchases faster when they meet next week. Officials announced plans to slow those purchases by $15 billion a month, which would have the program ending midway through 2022. Ending those purchases would set the stage for interest rate increases, the Fed’s most powerful tool to cool down the economy. By Emma Goldberg  Better.com’s mercurial chief executive, Vishal Garg, faced swift backlash for his decision to fire more than 900 employees on a Zoom call last week. The mortgage lender’s board announced in a memo sent to staff on Friday that Mr. Garg was “taking time off” after the “very regrettable events.” “I come to you with not great news,” Mr. Garg had said to about 9 percent of his staff, in a recording since shared widely online. “If you’re on this call you are part of the unlucky group that is being laid off. Your employment here is terminated effective immediately.” Better.com, which is backed by SoftBank, has brought on a third-party firm to assess its leadership and culture, according to a copy of the board’s memo obtained by The New York Times. Several top employees resigned following the firings, two in communications and one in marketing. Better.com did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Christian Chapman, 41, a former underwriting trainer at Better.com, said he was used to preparing for company meetings by making sure his children weren’t around, because Mr. Garg tended to use foul language. But last Wednesday, when he received an unexpected invitation to the company call with Mr. Garg, he got a sense of foreboding because the chief executive looked so solemn. As Mr. Garg impassively delivered the news, Mr. Chapman said his “gut dropped to the floor,” and he tried to message teammates to ask what was happening but his computer access was shut off almost immediately. “I’ve been through layoffs and usually there’s closure because you talk to H.R., you go to your desk and grab your personal belongings and say goodbyes,” Mr. Chapman said. “There’s no closure here. You’re staring at an empty screen in your house.” It took about three hours for him to receive a follow-up email, reviewed by The Times, that explained the terms of the termination, Mr. Chapman added. On Thursday, the company increased his termination package from one to two months of pay. He also received a Christmas package containing a trophy, certificate and company T-shirt (which his wife offered to burn). Mr. Chapman said that the chief executive’s messaging about fired employees “stealing” from the company by working only two hours a day — which the former employee said was contradicted by his team’s recent promotions and raises — had made it challenging for them to apply for new jobs. Mr. Garg has apologized for his behavior on the Zoom call. In a memo dated Tuesday that was posted on the company’s site, Mr. Garg said he owned the choice to make layoffs but had “blundered” the approach. By Stanley Reed  An oil project off the coast of Scotland that had become a test of Britain’s environmental credentials was shelved by its main owner on Friday. The decision to halt Cambo, as the oil field is known, is a huge win for environmental groups like Greenpeace, and a blow to the North Sea oil industry. It comes just over a week after Shell, which owns 30 percent of the project, pulled out of the investment. “We are pausing the development while we evaluate next steps,” said Siccar Point Energy, a London-based company that is backed by private equity firms, including Blackstone, the financial management giant. Siccar Point said it had planned to invest $2.6 billion in Cambo, and had already spent $190 million on the field since acquiring it in 2017. The firm said that developing Cambo, a potentially valuable source of oil and natural gas, would have created 1,000 jobs. Environmental groups, on the other hand, said that starting new drilling projects was not compatible with Britain’s goals on tackling climate change and reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The British government has been considering whether to let Cambo go ahead. Located northwest of Scotland’s Shetland Islands, Cambo became a target of protests, including at the recent United Nations climate summit in Glasgow. Scotland’s top politician, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, has said she did not think it should be given a green light. On Dec. 2, Shell said it would not go ahead with investment because the economic case was not strong enough. Shell’s decision, which was also prompted by the potential for delays from protests and lawsuits, led Siccar Point to decide it could not “progress on the originally planned time scale,” the firm said. By Stephen Gandel  The U.S. stock market has been on a run, with the S&P 500 up nearly 4 percent so far this week, and more than 25 percent for the year. Fears about the Omicron variant of the coronavirus quickly faded, with stocks regaining lost ground. This makes some market watchers nervous, the DealBook newsletter reports, because of a metric that suggests that stock prices may be too high given the level of corporate earnings and rising inflation. The S&P 500 now has a real earnings yield — the inflation-adjusted ratio of earnings per share to the stock price — approaching negative 3 percent, the lowest since 1947, Bank of America equity strategists led by Savita Subramanian wrote in a recent note to clients. Negative yields are rare and often precede a stock market slump, the analysts wrote. A low earnings yield means that corporate profits are not keeping up with stock prices. And because real yields subtract inflation from the measure, a negative real earnings yield means that a company, based on its stock price, is not generating enough profits to keep up with rising prices. (Using October’s inflation number, Tesla’s real earnings yield is negative 5.2 percent.) The last time the S&P 500 had a negative real earnings yield, the Bank of America analysts said, was in 2000, before the tech bubble burst. It also happened twice during the stagflation of the 1970s and ’80s. This year, the S&P 500’s real earnings yield turned negative months ago, but it really sank recently as inflation has marched higher. Besides a bear market, there are two ways a negative earnings yield can turn positive: First, inflation would have to drop significantly, which some economists think is possible. Second, at a time when wages are rising and supply issues are interfering with plans, corporate profits could accelerate faster than expected. After the initial shock of the pandemic, stocks have shrugged off negative news and set a series of records. But the more that analysts consider the numbers, the more they worry that the gravity-defying rise may not last much longer. (Stocks fell on Thursday.) That said, “we live in a world where real negative rates are almost acceptable as a norm,” Ms. Subramanian noted. By Michael J. de la Merced  The Securities and Exchange Commission’s chair, Gary Gensler, has made clear for months that he is worried about the risks faced by investors in special purpose acquisition companies, which over the past two years have become a hugely popular way to take businesses public. In a speech on Thursday, he elaborated on one of the S.E.C.’s main focuses in reducing those risks — with measures that could shake up the industry, the DealBook newsletter reports. Mr. Gensler noted that SPACs are allowed to pitch potential investors using forward-looking business data that isn’t allowed in initial public offerings. That loophole, he said, allows the financiers behind these funds to release rosy-looking numbers that mask the underlying health of the business they’re taking public. (The S.E.C. has been looking into disclosure issues in SPAC deals involving the likes of Nikola and Lucid.) It now looks as if the S.E.C. may require SPACs to provide more complete disclosures about their deals, and to do so earlier: “It is essential that investors receive the information they need, when they need it, without misleading hype,” Mr. Gensler said. He also suggested that the people behind SPACs, including their sponsors, financial advisers and accountants, should be held more accountable for their due diligence on the companies these funds acquire, much as underwriters of I.P.O.s are. “Make no mistake: When it comes to liability, SPACs do not provide a ‘free pass’ for gatekeepers,” he said in his speech. The goal is to even out the playing field between SPACs and I.P.O.s. Deal makers have expected financial regulators to tighten the rules governing blank-check funds, amid an explosion in their popularity and the underperformance of many companies that have used them to go public, but Mr. Gensler’s comments shed further light on what that might look like. By Jack Ewing  Daimler’s car and truck divisions concluded an amicable divorce on Friday when shares in Daimler Truck began trading separately on the Frankfurt stock exchange. The separation of Mercedes-Benz, the luxury carmaker, from Daimler Truck, which owns Freightliner in the United States, signaled the end of an era not only for Daimler but also the German economy. The spinoff, announced in February, was the final chapter in a transition that began in the 1990s, when Daimler was a sprawling conglomerate that also made trains and passenger aircraft. Along with other industrial empires like Siemens, Daimler has been forced to jettison excess baggage to remain competitive. For car and truck makers, the need to ditch unwieldy corporate structures has become even more urgent as they try to survive the shift to emission-free propulsion. One justification for the spinoff is that it will allow Daimler Truck’s managers to make decisions more quickly. Daimler Truck is betting on hydrogen fuel cells for long-haul trucks, in contrast to competitors like Scania that favor batteries. It is not yet clear which technology will prevail. A few decades ago, many German companies operated on the principle that bigger was better. That might have made sense when capital was harder to come by, said Martin Daum, the chief executive of Daimler Truck, because the more profitable parts of a conglomerate could generate cash for struggling units. “We had globally very inefficient capital markets,” Mr. Daum said in an interview. “That supported the buildup of conglomerates.” “Today, every business that has a compelling idea can raise money,” he said. Whether Daimler Truck has compelling ideas will now be put to the test. The shares opened Friday at 28 euros (about $31.60) and rose as much as 8.5 percent, valuing the company at about $27 billion. The new company is the largest truck maker in the United States by way of its Freightliner brand. Globally, Daimler Truck is also the largest maker of buses. Its other brands include Mercedes-Benz trucks and buses sold primarily in Europe and Fuso trucks sold in Asia. Daimler Truck and Mercedes-Benz luxury cars will remain closely connected. Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes, will retain a 35 percent stake in Daimler Truck. The remaining shares will be distributed to Daimler shareholders. BNP Paribas, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs are serving as listing agents for the spinoff."

The rising costs spell trouble for officials at the Federal Reserve and the White House, who are trying to calibrate policy at a moment when the labor market has yet to completely heal from the pandemic, but the risk that price increases could become more lasting is increasing. The Consumer Price Index climbed by 6.8 percent in the year through November, the data showed, the fastest pace since 1982. After stripping out food and fuel, which can move around a lot from month to month, inflation climbed by 4.9 percent. Prices were up 0.8 percent from October, according to the report. That’s slightly slower than the prior monthly increase, but still an unusually rapid pace. The question is what happens next. Fed officials have become increasingly concerned about rising price — both because the uptick has lasted longer than expected and because it shows signs of broadening to areas less affected by the pandemic. Earlier this year, prices increases were concentrated in goods. Used cars and couches were in demand as the pandemic changed people’s lifestyles, but factories around the world struggled to keep up with the surge in buying, in part because shutdowns tied to the virus upended production. Shipping routes and ports also became clogged as demand followed an atypical pattern, with too many U.S.-bound goods trying to leave Asia in particular. Those disruptions were expected to be temporary. Instead, they have lasted for months, as demand for goods remains strong and because the virus continues to upend production. As pandemic quirks persist, inflationary pressures are also broadening. That includes rental prices, which have surged after an initial slackening during the pandemic and are helping to push up overall price gains. It’s a worrying development for the Fed as it considers its next policy steps. “Generally, the higher prices we’re seeing are related to the supply-and-demand imbalances that can be traced directly back to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, but it’s also the case that price increases have spread much more broadly in the recent few months,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during congressional testimony late last month. “I think the risk of higher inflation has increased.” Fed officials are closely watching what happens with wages — and with consumer inflation expectations — as they try to gauge when and how much inflation will fade. But they are also starting to acknowledge that they might have to react to rising prices. Mr. Powell signaled last week that the Fed, which began cutting back on economic support last month, will discuss speeding up that process at its Dec. 14-15 meeting. Economists expect central bankers to announce a plan to slow down their monthly bond purchases fast enough so that the program ends several months earlier, putting Fed officials in a position to raise their benchmark interest rate, their more traditional and more powerful tool. Friday’s data will keep policymakers on track to accelerate their plans to taper off bond purchases, said Alan Detmeister, a senior economist at UBS and former chief of the wages and prices division at the Fed Board in Washington. “This is still an enormous — a very, very strong — number,” Mr. Detmeister said, explaining that while he expects inflation to moderate, it may take until the middle of next year for that to show up clearly in the year-over-year data. “It seems pretty clear that they’re going to speed up the taper,” he added. Moving to the next step — raising rates — would make debt of all kinds, from mortgages to car and business loans, more expensive. That would likely slow spending and hiring, cooling off demand and weighing down buoyant housing costs. The combination could help to put a lid on price gains. But it could also leave the country with a less competitive labor market. That could be bad if the millions of people who remain out of the labor market compared to before the pandemic — many of them because of child-care issues and other virus-tied concerns — decide to embark on a job hunt. Even so, the Fed is wary of letting inflation rocket out of control. In the 1960s, the central bank failed to take sufficiently decisive action to tamp down rising prices. Inflation leapt out of control, rising to double-digit levels during the 1970s, and Paul Volcker, then the Fed chair, pushed interest rates up sharply to get things under control in the early 1980s. The hit to demand caused a painful recession before it brought price gains to heel. The mistake, and its aftermath, has haunted central bankers’s nightmares ever since. As housing and other day-to-day costs rise, workers may begin to ask for raises to help offset the financial blow. Employers are competing for laborers at a time when job openings far exceed the number of people actively looking for jobs, and wages are rising at a brisk pace. The Employment Cost Index, a measure the Fed watches closely, picked up notably in the three-month period that ended in September. Increased pay has not been enough to fully offset inflation for most people: Wage gains are up sharply, especially for low earners, but are not rising quickly enough to keep up with the acceleration in prices. And as companies that face rising input and labor costs seek to pass those on to consumers, it may actually help to keep prices rising. Big companies are managing to remain profitable as parts from overseas and commodities like gas climb in price, in part because they are successfully handing off those costs to consumers. Profit margins for nonfinancial companies have been increasing at a brisk pace this year, including in some of the industries hardest-hit by supply problems. “Inventories of automobiles continued to shrink, but dealers saw strong profits because of high prices of vehicles,” the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a collection of regional economic reports, noted from the Richmond district. By Madeleine Ngo  A jump in inflation in November was partly fueled by rising prices for food and rent, which have increasingly posed a challenge for consumers and policymakers in Washington. A Labor Department report released on Friday showed that inflation jumped to the highest level in nearly 40 years, climbing by 6.8 percent in the year through November. The big number included a strong increase in food prices, which rose 6.1 percent from a year earlier, according to the Consumer Price Index report. The 0.7 increase in November came on the heels of several months of strong gains: The food index climbed 0.9 percent in October and September. Rent also rose 0.4 percent last month, reflecting a tight housing market that is feeding into inflation. The surge in rent costs has stemmed from strong demand for owned homes and as people have searched for extra space but found that houses were in short supply. The rise in prices puts pressure on the Federal Reserve, which is discussing whether to end its bond-buying program faster. That would put it in a position to start to lift interest rates, which the central bank has held at near zero since the beginning of the pandemic. Inflation has continued to surge as supply chain disruptions, strong demand for goods and rising wages have pushed prices higher, complicating President Biden’s agenda and depressing his approval ratings. Americans have felt the increase in prices, which has dented their finances and forced them to cut back in other ways. Consumers have grown more wary of the jump in costs, expressing less optimism about their personal finances and the overall growth of the economy, according to a recent University of Michigan survey. Alan Detmeister, a senior economist at UBS who used to be chief of the wages and prices division at the Fed Board in Washington, said that rents would continue to move up substantially in the near term. But real-time trackers like Apartment List have showed some softening in recent readings, which could be a good sign that those pressures will cool off toward the middle of 2022. “While we’re probably going to be seeing some strong rents for the near term, those are probably going to be slowing,” Mr. Detmeister said. Jayson Lusk, an agricultural economist at Purdue University, said that food prices had increased as people’s savings rose during the pandemic. That has given them the ability to pay more, making them more willing to accept price increases. Companies in the food industry have also increased wages to attract more workers, and have tried to pass along those costs. Dirk Van de Put, the chief executive of Mondelez International, told CNBC last month that the company — which makes Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and Sour Patch Kids candy — expected to increase prices by 7 percent next year. The company has faced higher costs for commodities, packaging and transportation, he said. “It is very difficult to keep our clients well-stocked,” he said. “Our on shelf availability is nowhere near where we would like it to be.” Although millions of people have seen their savings grow, that has started to dwindle for many working- and middle-class households. Higher food costs have a disproportionate impact on lower-income people, who tend to spend more of their income on food, Mr. Lusk said. Diana Madoshi, a retired nurse in Placer County, Calif., who relies on Social Security benefits, said that higher prices at the grocery store had started to burden her budget. A carton of eggs, which used to cost about $2.80 before the pandemic, now can cost nearly $4, she said. To offset the amount she is paying for food, Ms. Madoshi said she had been taking fewer Uber rides to her doctor appointments, instead having her friends drive her. She said she had also cut back the amount of clothes she had been buying during the pandemic. “This is just another harsh reality of what we’re going through right now,” said Ms. Madoshi, 75. “And there’s nothing I can do about that.” By Talmon Joseph Smith  Inflation’s surge in the United States has been driven in part by a substantial increase in energy and prices over the last year, although there has been some moderation in recent weeks. According to the Consumer Price Index, the 12-month change in energy prices as of November was 33.3 percent, nearly five times the overall inflation rate. The cost for gasoline moved higher by 6.1 percent last month — a burden for households, particularly as the holiday travel season begins — and by 58.1 percent in the last year. Prices for fuel oil — which is used for industrial and home heating — rose 3.5 percent last month, though that rate was far tamer than October’s 12.3 percent increase. If that easing continues, it may provide some measure of relief for households bracing for crippling household winter heating bills, but fuel oil is still up 59.3 percent on a yearly basis. In better news, electricity prices were up a more modest 0.3 percent last month — a break from October’s 1.8 percent increase, but still 6.5 percent higherthan a year earlier. Unlike in some other commodity sectors, increased energy prices in the market are quickly passed through to consumers, who have become accustomed to cheaper energy prices in recent years and now find themselves rankled by the sudden pressure put on their budgets. “Households are facing higher prices at every turn,” said Greg McBride, the chief financial analyst at Bankrate, a personal finance company. The recent jumps in energy, food and shelter, he said, “are putting a major squeeze on household budgets.” Those three expenses account for more than half of the weighting in the Consumer Price Index. Energy alone accounts for 7.5 percent. Because energy and food prices are notoriously volatile, the government reports separate inflation figures, including and excluding those categories. Including all categories, the one-month rise in November was 6.8 percent; without food and energy, it was 4.9 percent. The surge in consumer prices is likely to intensify debates in Washington over the continuation of uncomfortably high inflation numbers — especially for core expenses such as energy that households can’t go without — and how policymakers can address them. Republicans in Congress and lobbying groups for the oil and gas industry have filleted the Biden White House for higher energy prices; however, nonpartisan industry researchers have noted the overall weak relationship between a given administration’s level of support for renewable fuels and the arc of fossil fuel prices. The George W. Bush administration, for instance, was noted for its connections to the oil and gas industry, yet during Mr. Bush’s second term, energy prices were often higher than today. And the Obama administration — whose clean-energy initiatives were prominent — benefited from a private-sector fracking boom on its watch, which increased supply and made gas and home heating relatively cheap for years. Good news about energy prices has been uncommon for consumers lately. But recent moves in the market have indicated that the weather may cut them at least a temporary break. Natural gas, used to heat almost half of U.S. households, almost doubled in price earlier this fall, but sank by more than 10 percent at one point this week after the release of government weather forecasts projecting a warmer-than-expected winter. Several states have had some of their warmest December days on record. And according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center, above-average temperatures throughout the South and most of the East could predominate for most of this winter. “If it’s a warmer winter, then our estimates about consumption will be down, and if consumption is down, that’ll reduce the price of the fuel,” said Mark Wolfe, the executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association, a group of state officials that provide assistance to households in need. “It’s a good sign.” Much like retail businesses, energy producers have had to wrestle with imbalances in the economy caused by the pandemic shock and a halting reopening of activity. An analysis this month from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas noted that oil-field activity in the region had risen steadily over the last month and a half, but that “supply-chain delays worsened, with significantly larger backlogs, escalating costs, and material and equipment lead times as long as 10 months for some types of machinery.” By Jim Tankersley  The Labor Department’s announcement on Friday that the Consumer Price Index rose 0.8 percent in November and 6.8 percent from the year before is the latest sign of rapid price increases eroding President Biden’s approval ratings on the economy and threatening the expansive economic and climate legislation he is trying to push through Congress by the end of the year. Voters and a crucial Democrat in the Senate, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, have become increasingly concerned with the rising inflation that now ranks as America’s fastest annual price growth in four decades. A string of recent polls show inflation now ranks as the top economic concern nationwide, a product of rising costs for gasoline, food and a variety of goods that Americans have bought in droves as the country emerges from the pandemic recession. Mr. Manchin is a centrist who looms as the most likely Democrat to vote against Mr. Biden’s $2.2 trillion legislation, which the president is trying to pass along party lines, given Republicans have no intention of voting for the bill. Mr. Biden will need every Democrat in the Senate to support the measure for it to pass. Mr. Manchin has in recent days repeated his fear that the spending in the bill, which includes initiatives to fight climate change and invest in children, parents and workers, could exacerbate price increases further — a claim that administration officials and Mr. Biden say is unfounded. The president has attempted in recent weeks to balance his efforts to cast the recovery as strong — citing job gains, falling unemployment claims, nominal wage growth and the fastest economic growth since the mid-1980s — with acknowledgment that inflation has hurt American families’ wallets. And he has stressed the actions his administration has taken to unclog supply chains that are contributing to price increases. In a statement on Friday, Mr. Biden said the data did not reflect more recent trends, which he said showed prices moving down for cars and gasoline, among others. “Today’s numbers reflect the pressures that economies around the world are facing as we emerge from a global pandemic — prices are rising,” he said. “But developments in the weeks after these data were collected last month show that price and cost increase are slowing, although not as quickly as we’d like.” “Even with this progress,” Mr. Biden added, “price increases continue to squeeze family budgets. We are making progress on pandemic-related challenges to our supply chain which make it more expensive to get goods on shelves, and I expect more progress on that in the weeks ahead.” Mr. Biden’s aides have said throughout the year that the expect the current bout of inflation to fade quickly, as supply chain issues work themselves out and the world continues to emerge from the pandemic. Those predictions have frequently proven overly optimistic. But administration officials made another round of them this week ahead of the Labor Department release, saying they expected the drivers of inflation, like rising prices for used cars, to prove temporary and the rate of inflation to fall sharply in the first half of 2022. Administration officials also say they already see signs that other main drivers of price increases, like gasoline, are cooling off. Energy prices were up 33 percent from a year ago in the November report, and gasoline prices were up 58 percent. But the cost of a gallon at the pump began to fall in recent weeks, and so has the cost of natural gas. Republican lawmakers on Friday continued to point fingers at Mr. Biden for the rising costs and said Democrats would exacerbate inflation with their $2.2 trillion spending bill. “Senate Democrats should suspend any consideration of Biden’s inflation-driving Build Back Better spending binge until the president can demonstrate he can get inflation under control,” Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and ranking member on the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement. By Coral Murphy Marcos  S&P 500 - % Dow - % Nasdaq - % As of  Data delayed at least 15 minutes Source: FactSet Stocks on Wall Street jumped on Friday, with the S&P 500 on track for its best week since February, after inflation report that showed consumer prices were rising fast but was nevertheless in line with economists expectations. The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent in early trading, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1 percent. The S&P 500 has been rebounding this week, as concerns about the Omicron variant of the coronavirus eased somewhat even as it continues to spread. The benchmark index is poised to close the week with a gain of about 3 percent, within striking distance of a record.The gains on Friday came despite a Labor Department report that showed the Consumer Price Index rose at the fastest pace in nearly 40 years, up by 6.8 percent last month compared with a year earlier. The inflation measure rose 0.8 percent from October, which is a slightly slower rate in month-to-month increases. Officials at the Federal Reserve officials have been watching inflation data closely for the past several months, and signaled that the bank was ready to speed up its pullback on monetary policy stimulus that had helped support the economy since the pandemic started. The latest data adds to concerns that what was initially a burst of reopening-driven inflation could linger longer than policymakers first expected.Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, has said he expects central bank officials to address slowing bond purchases faster when they meet next week. Officials announced plans to slow those purchases by $15 billion a month, which would have the program ending midway through 2022. Ending those purchases would set the stage for interest rate increases, the Fed’s most powerful tool to cool down the economy. By Emma Goldberg  Better.com’s mercurial chief executive, Vishal Garg, faced swift backlash for his decision to fire more than 900 employees on a Zoom call last week. The mortgage lender’s board announced in a memo sent to staff on Friday that Mr. Garg was “taking time off” after the “very regrettable events.” “I come to you with not great news,” Mr. Garg had said to about 9 percent of his staff, in a recording since shared widely online. “If you’re on this call you are part of the unlucky group that is being laid off. Your employment here is terminated effective immediately.” Better.com, which is backed by SoftBank, has brought on a third-party firm to assess its leadership and culture, according to a copy of the board’s memo obtained by The New York Times. Several top employees resigned following the firings, two in communications and one in marketing. Better.com did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Christian Chapman, 41, a former underwriting trainer at Better.com, said he was used to preparing for company meetings by making sure his children weren’t around, because Mr. Garg tended to use foul language. But last Wednesday, when he received an unexpected invitation to the company call with Mr. Garg, he got a sense of foreboding because the chief executive looked so solemn. As Mr. Garg impassively delivered the news, Mr. Chapman said his “gut dropped to the floor,” and he tried to message teammates to ask what was happening but his computer access was shut off almost immediately. “I’ve been through layoffs and usually there’s closure because you talk to H.R., you go to your desk and grab your personal belongings and say goodbyes,” Mr. Chapman said. “There’s no closure here. You’re staring at an empty screen in your house.” It took about three hours for him to receive a follow-up email, reviewed by The Times, that explained the terms of the termination, Mr. Chapman added. On Thursday, the company increased his termination package from one to two months of pay. He also received a Christmas package containing a trophy, certificate and company T-shirt (which his wife offered to burn). Mr. Chapman said that the chief executive’s messaging about fired employees “stealing” from the company by working only two hours a day — which the former employee said was contradicted by his team’s recent promotions and raises — had made it challenging for them to apply for new jobs. Mr. Garg has apologized for his behavior on the Zoom call. In a memo dated Tuesday that was posted on the company’s site, Mr. Garg said he owned the choice to make layoffs but had “blundered” the approach. By Stanley Reed  An oil project off the coast of Scotland that had become a test of Britain’s environmental credentials was shelved by its main owner on Friday. The decision to halt Cambo, as the oil field is known, is a huge win for environmental groups like Greenpeace, and a blow to the North Sea oil industry. It comes just over a week after Shell, which owns 30 percent of the project, pulled out of the investment. “We are pausing the development while we evaluate next steps,” said Siccar Point Energy, a London-based company that is backed by private equity firms, including Blackstone, the financial management giant. Siccar Point said it had planned to invest $2.6 billion in Cambo, and had already spent $190 million on the field since acquiring it in 2017. The firm said that developing Cambo, a potentially valuable source of oil and natural gas, would have created 1,000 jobs. Environmental groups, on the other hand, said that starting new drilling projects was not compatible with Britain’s goals on tackling climate change and reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The British government has been considering whether to let Cambo go ahead. Located northwest of Scotland’s Shetland Islands, Cambo became a target of protests, including at the recent United Nations climate summit in Glasgow. Scotland’s top politician, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, has said she did not think it should be given a green light. On Dec. 2, Shell said it would not go ahead with investment because the economic case was not strong enough. Shell’s decision, which was also prompted by the potential for delays from protests and lawsuits, led Siccar Point to decide it could not “progress on the originally planned time scale,” the firm said. By Stephen Gandel  The U.S. stock market has been on a run, with the S&P 500 up nearly 4 percent so far this week, and more than 25 percent for the year. Fears about the Omicron variant of the coronavirus quickly faded, with stocks regaining lost ground. This makes some market watchers nervous, the DealBook newsletter reports, because of a metric that suggests that stock prices may be too high given the level of corporate earnings and rising inflation. The S&P 500 now has a real earnings yield — the inflation-adjusted ratio of earnings per share to the stock price — approaching negative 3 percent, the lowest since 1947, Bank of America equity strategists led by Savita Subramanian wrote in a recent note to clients. Negative yields are rare and often precede a stock market slump, the analysts wrote. A low earnings yield means that corporate profits are not keeping up with stock prices. And because real yields subtract inflation from the measure, a negative real earnings yield means that a company, based on its stock price, is not generating enough profits to keep up with rising prices. (Using October’s inflation number, Tesla’s real earnings yield is negative 5.2 percent.) The last time the S&P 500 had a negative real earnings yield, the Bank of America analysts said, was in 2000, before the tech bubble burst. It also happened twice during the stagflation of the 1970s and ’80s. This year, the S&P 500’s real earnings yield turned negative months ago, but it really sank recently as inflation has marched higher. Besides a bear market, there are two ways a negative earnings yield can turn positive: First, inflation would have to drop significantly, which some economists think is possible. Second, at a time when wages are rising and supply issues are interfering with plans, corporate profits could accelerate faster than expected. After the initial shock of the pandemic, stocks have shrugged off negative news and set a series of records. But the more that analysts consider the numbers, the more they worry that the gravity-defying rise may not last much longer. (Stocks fell on Thursday.) That said, “we live in a world where real negative rates are almost acceptable as a norm,” Ms. Subramanian noted. By Michael J. de la Merced  The Securities and Exchange Commission’s chair, Gary Gensler, has made clear for months that he is worried about the risks faced by investors in special purpose acquisition companies, which over the past two years have become a hugely popular way to take businesses public. In a speech on Thursday, he elaborated on one of the S.E.C.’s main focuses in reducing those risks — with measures that could shake up the industry, the DealBook newsletter reports. Mr. Gensler noted that SPACs are allowed to pitch potential investors using forward-looking business data that isn’t allowed in initial public offerings. That loophole, he said, allows the financiers behind these funds to release rosy-looking numbers that mask the underlying health of the business they’re taking public. (The S.E.C. has been looking into disclosure issues in SPAC deals involving the likes of Nikola and Lucid.) It now looks as if the S.E.C. may require SPACs to provide more complete disclosures about their deals, and to do so earlier: “It is essential that investors receive the information they need, when they need it, without misleading hype,” Mr. Gensler said. He also suggested that the people behind SPACs, including their sponsors, financial advisers and accountants, should be held more accountable for their due diligence on the companies these funds acquire, much as underwriters of I.P.O.s are. “Make no mistake: When it comes to liability, SPACs do not provide a ‘free pass’ for gatekeepers,” he said in his speech. The goal is to even out the playing field between SPACs and I.P.O.s. Deal makers have expected financial regulators to tighten the rules governing blank-check funds, amid an explosion in their popularity and the underperformance of many companies that have used them to go public, but Mr. Gensler’s comments shed further light on what that might look like. By Jack Ewing  Daimler’s car and truck divisions concluded an amicable divorce on Friday when shares in Daimler Truck began trading separately on the Frankfurt stock exchange. The separation of Mercedes-Benz, the luxury carmaker, from Daimler Truck, which owns Freightliner in the United States, signaled the end of an era not only for Daimler but also the German economy. The spinoff, announced in February, was the final chapter in a transition that began in the 1990s, when Daimler was a sprawling conglomerate that also made trains and passenger aircraft. Along with other industrial empires like Siemens, Daimler has been forced to jettison excess baggage to remain competitive. For car and truck makers, the need to ditch unwieldy corporate structures has become even more urgent as they try to survive the shift to emission-free propulsion. One justification for the spinoff is that it will allow Daimler Truck’s managers to make decisions more quickly. Daimler Truck is betting on hydrogen fuel cells for long-haul trucks, in contrast to competitors like Scania that favor batteries. It is not yet clear which technology will prevail. A few decades ago, many German companies operated on the principle that bigger was better. That might have made sense when capital was harder to come by, said Martin Daum, the chief executive of Daimler Truck, because the more profitable parts of a conglomerate could generate cash for struggling units. “We had globally very inefficient capital markets,” Mr. Daum said in an interview. “That supported the buildup of conglomerates.” “Today, every business that has a compelling idea can raise money,” he said. Whether Daimler Truck has compelling ideas will now be put to the test. The shares opened Friday at 28 euros (about $31.60) and rose as much as 8.5 percent, valuing the company at about $27 billion. The new company is the largest truck maker in the United States by way of its Freightliner brand. Globally, Daimler Truck is also the largest maker of buses. Its other brands include Mercedes-Benz trucks and buses sold primarily in Europe and Fuso trucks sold in Asia. Daimler Truck and Mercedes-Benz luxury cars will remain closely connected. Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes, will retain a 35 percent stake in Daimler Truck. The remaining shares will be distributed to Daimler shareholders. BNP Paribas, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs are serving as listing agents for the spinoff."

The rising costs spell trouble for officials at the Federal Reserve and the White House, who are trying to calibrate policy at a moment when the labor market has yet to completely heal from the pandemic, but the risk that price increases could become more lasting is increasing. The Consumer Price Index climbed by 6.8 percent in the year through November, the data showed, the fastest pace since 1982. After stripping out food and fuel, which can move around a lot from month to month, inflation climbed by 4.9 percent. Prices were up 0.8 percent from October, according to the report. That’s slightly slower than the prior monthly increase, but still an unusually rapid pace. The question is what happens next. Fed officials have become increasingly concerned about rising price — both because the uptick has lasted longer than expected and because it shows signs of broadening to areas less affected by the pandemic. Earlier this year, prices increases were concentrated in goods. Used cars and couches were in demand as the pandemic changed people’s lifestyles, but factories around the world struggled to keep up with the surge in buying, in part because shutdowns tied to the virus upended production. Shipping routes and ports also became clogged as demand followed an atypical pattern, with too many U.S.-bound goods trying to leave Asia in particular. Those disruptions were expected to be temporary. Instead, they have lasted for months, as demand for goods remains strong and because the virus continues to upend production. As pandemic quirks persist, inflationary pressures are also broadening. That includes rental prices, which have surged after an initial slackening during the pandemic and are helping to push up overall price gains. It’s a worrying development for the Fed as it considers its next policy steps. “Generally, the higher prices we’re seeing are related to the supply-and-demand imbalances that can be traced directly back to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, but it’s also the case that price increases have spread much more broadly in the recent few months,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during congressional testimony late last month. “I think the risk of higher inflation has increased.” Fed officials are closely watching what happens with wages — and with consumer inflation expectations — as they try to gauge when and how much inflation will fade. But they are also starting to acknowledge that they might have to react to rising prices. Mr. Powell signaled last week that the Fed, which began cutting back on economic support last month, will discuss speeding up that process at its Dec. 14-15 meeting. Economists expect central bankers to announce a plan to slow down their monthly bond purchases fast enough so that the program ends several months earlier, putting Fed officials in a position to raise their benchmark interest rate, their more traditional and more powerful tool. Friday’s data will keep policymakers on track to accelerate their plans to taper off bond purchases, said Alan Detmeister, a senior economist at UBS and former chief of the wages and prices division at the Fed Board in Washington. “This is still an enormous — a very, very strong — number,” Mr. Detmeister said, explaining that while he expects inflation to moderate, it may take until the middle of next year for that to show up clearly in the year-over-year data. “It seems pretty clear that they’re going to speed up the taper,” he added. Moving to the next step — raising rates — would make debt of all kinds, from mortgages to car and business loans, more expensive. That would likely slow spending and hiring, cooling off demand and weighing down buoyant housing costs. The combination could help to put a lid on price gains. But it could also leave the country with a less competitive labor market. That could be bad if the millions of people who remain out of the labor market compared to before the pandemic — many of them because of child-care issues and other virus-tied concerns — decide to embark on a job hunt. Even so, the Fed is wary of letting inflation rocket out of control. In the 1960s, the central bank failed to take sufficiently decisive action to tamp down rising prices. Inflation leapt out of control, rising to double-digit levels during the 1970s, and Paul Volcker, then the Fed chair, pushed interest rates up sharply to get things under control in the early 1980s. The hit to demand caused a painful recession before it brought price gains to heel. The mistake, and its aftermath, has haunted central bankers’s nightmares ever since. As housing and other day-to-day costs rise, workers may begin to ask for raises to help offset the financial blow. Employers are competing for laborers at a time when job openings far exceed the number of people actively looking for jobs, and wages are rising at a brisk pace. The Employment Cost Index, a measure the Fed watches closely, picked up notably in the three-month period that ended in September. Increased pay has not been enough to fully offset inflation for most people: Wage gains are up sharply, especially for low earners, but are not rising quickly enough to keep up with the acceleration in prices. And as companies that face rising input and labor costs seek to pass those on to consumers, it may actually help to keep prices rising. Big companies are managing to remain profitable as parts from overseas and commodities like gas climb in price, in part because they are successfully handing off those costs to consumers. Profit margins for nonfinancial companies have been increasing at a brisk pace this year, including in some of the industries hardest-hit by supply problems. “Inventories of automobiles continued to shrink, but dealers saw strong profits because of high prices of vehicles,” the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a collection of regional economic reports, noted from the Richmond district. By Madeleine Ngo  A jump in inflation in November was partly fueled by rising prices for food and rent, which have increasingly posed a challenge for consumers and policymakers in Washington. A Labor Department report released on Friday showed that inflation jumped to the highest level in nearly 40 years, climbing by 6.8 percent in the year through November. The big number included a strong increase in food prices, which rose 6.1 percent from a year earlier, according to the Consumer Price Index report. The 0.7 increase in November came on the heels of several months of strong gains: The food index climbed 0.9 percent in October and September. Rent also rose 0.4 percent last month, reflecting a tight housing market that is feeding into inflation. The surge in rent costs has stemmed from strong demand for owned homes and as people have searched for extra space but found that houses were in short supply. The rise in prices puts pressure on the Federal Reserve, which is discussing whether to end its bond-buying program faster. That would put it in a position to start to lift interest rates, which the central bank has held at near zero since the beginning of the pandemic. Inflation has continued to surge as supply chain disruptions, strong demand for goods and rising wages have pushed prices higher, complicating President Biden’s agenda and depressing his approval ratings. Americans have felt the increase in prices, which has dented their finances and forced them to cut back in other ways. Consumers have grown more wary of the jump in costs, expressing less optimism about their personal finances and the overall growth of the economy, according to a recent University of Michigan survey. Alan Detmeister, a senior economist at UBS who used to be chief of the wages and prices division at the Fed Board in Washington, said that rents would continue to move up substantially in the near term. But real-time trackers like Apartment List have showed some softening in recent readings, which could be a good sign that those pressures will cool off toward the middle of 2022. “While we’re probably going to be seeing some strong rents for the near term, those are probably going to be slowing,” Mr. Detmeister said. Jayson Lusk, an agricultural economist at Purdue University, said that food prices had increased as people’s savings rose during the pandemic. That has given them the ability to pay more, making them more willing to accept price increases. Companies in the food industry have also increased wages to attract more workers, and have tried to pass along those costs. Dirk Van de Put, the chief executive of Mondelez International, told CNBC last month that the company — which makes Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and Sour Patch Kids candy — expected to increase prices by 7 percent next year. The company has faced higher costs for commodities, packaging and transportation, he said. “It is very difficult to keep our clients well-stocked,” he said. “Our on shelf availability is nowhere near where we would like it to be.” Although millions of people have seen their savings grow, that has started to dwindle for many working- and middle-class households. Higher food costs have a disproportionate impact on lower-income people, who tend to spend more of their income on food, Mr. Lusk said. Diana Madoshi, a retired nurse in Placer County, Calif., who relies on Social Security benefits, said that higher prices at the grocery store had started to burden her budget. A carton of eggs, which used to cost about $2.80 before the pandemic, now can cost nearly $4, she said. To offset the amount she is paying for food, Ms. Madoshi said she had been taking fewer Uber rides to her doctor appointments, instead having her friends drive her. She said she had also cut back the amount of clothes she had been buying during the pandemic. “This is just another harsh reality of what we’re going through right now,” said Ms. Madoshi, 75. “And there’s nothing I can do about that.” By Talmon Joseph Smith  Inflation’s surge in the United States has been driven in part by a substantial increase in energy and prices over the last year, although there has been some moderation in recent weeks. According to the Consumer Price Index, the 12-month change in energy prices as of November was 33.3 percent, nearly five times the overall inflation rate. The cost for gasoline moved higher by 6.1 percent last month — a burden for households, particularly as the holiday travel season begins — and by 58.1 percent in the last year. Prices for fuel oil — which is used for industrial and home heating — rose 3.5 percent last month, though that rate was far tamer than October’s 12.3 percent increase. If that easing continues, it may provide some measure of relief for households bracing for crippling household winter heating bills, but fuel oil is still up 59.3 percent on a yearly basis. In better news, electricity prices were up a more modest 0.3 percent last month — a break from October’s 1.8 percent increase, but still 6.5 percent higherthan a year earlier. Unlike in some other commodity sectors, increased energy prices in the market are quickly passed through to consumers, who have become accustomed to cheaper energy prices in recent years and now find themselves rankled by the sudden pressure put on their budgets. “Households are facing higher prices at every turn,” said Greg McBride, the chief financial analyst at Bankrate, a personal finance company. The recent jumps in energy, food and shelter, he said, “are putting a major squeeze on household budgets.” Those three expenses account for more than half of the weighting in the Consumer Price Index. Energy alone accounts for 7.5 percent. Because energy and food prices are notoriously volatile, the government reports separate inflation figures, including and excluding those categories. Including all categories, the one-month rise in November was 6.8 percent; without food and energy, it was 4.9 percent. The surge in consumer prices is likely to intensify debates in Washington over the continuation of uncomfortably high inflation numbers — especially for core expenses such as energy that households can’t go without — and how policymakers can address them. Republicans in Congress and lobbying groups for the oil and gas industry have filleted the Biden White House for higher energy prices; however, nonpartisan industry researchers have noted the overall weak relationship between a given administration’s level of support for renewable fuels and the arc of fossil fuel prices. The George W. Bush administration, for instance, was noted for its connections to the oil and gas industry, yet during Mr. Bush’s second term, energy prices were often higher than today. And the Obama administration — whose clean-energy initiatives were prominent — benefited from a private-sector fracking boom on its watch, which increased supply and made gas and home heating relatively cheap for years. Good news about energy prices has been uncommon for consumers lately. But recent moves in the market have indicated that the weather may cut them at least a temporary break. Natural gas, used to heat almost half of U.S. households, almost doubled in price earlier this fall, but sank by more than 10 percent at one point this week after the release of government weather forecasts projecting a warmer-than-expected winter. Several states have had some of their warmest December days on record. And according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center, above-average temperatures throughout the South and most of the East could predominate for most of this winter. “If it’s a warmer winter, then our estimates about consumption will be down, and if consumption is down, that’ll reduce the price of the fuel,” said Mark Wolfe, the executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association, a group of state officials that provide assistance to households in need. “It’s a good sign.” Much like retail businesses, energy producers have had to wrestle with imbalances in the economy caused by the pandemic shock and a halting reopening of activity. An analysis this month from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas noted that oil-field activity in the region had risen steadily over the last month and a half, but that “supply-chain delays worsened, with significantly larger backlogs, escalating costs, and material and equipment lead times as long as 10 months for some types of machinery.” By Jim Tankersley  The Labor Department’s announcement on Friday that the Consumer Price Index rose 0.8 percent in November and 6.8 percent from the year before is the latest sign of rapid price increases eroding President Biden’s approval ratings on the economy and threatening the expansive economic and climate legislation he is trying to push through Congress by the end of the year. Voters and a crucial Democrat in the Senate, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, have become increasingly concerned with the rising inflation that now ranks as America’s fastest annual price growth in four decades. A string of recent polls show inflation now ranks as the top economic concern nationwide, a product of rising costs for gasoline, food and a variety of goods that Americans have bought in droves as the country emerges from the pandemic recession. Mr. Manchin is a centrist who looms as the most likely Democrat to vote against Mr. Biden’s $2.2 trillion legislation, which the president is trying to pass along party lines, given Republicans have no intention of voting for the bill. Mr. Biden will need every Democrat in the Senate to support the measure for it to pass. Mr. Manchin has in recent days repeated his fear that the spending in the bill, which includes initiatives to fight climate change and invest in children, parents and workers, could exacerbate price increases further — a claim that administration officials and Mr. Biden say is unfounded. The president has attempted in recent weeks to balance his efforts to cast the recovery as strong — citing job gains, falling unemployment claims, nominal wage growth and the fastest economic growth since the mid-1980s — with acknowledgment that inflation has hurt American families’ wallets. And he has stressed the actions his administration has taken to unclog supply chains that are contributing to price increases. In a statement on Friday, Mr. Biden said the data did not reflect more recent trends, which he said showed prices moving down for cars and gasoline, among others. “Today’s numbers reflect the pressures that economies around the world are facing as we emerge from a global pandemic — prices are rising,” he said. “But developments in the weeks after these data were collected last month show that price and cost increase are slowing, although not as quickly as we’d like.” “Even with this progress,” Mr. Biden added, “price increases continue to squeeze family budgets. We are making progress on pandemic-related challenges to our supply chain which make it more expensive to get goods on shelves, and I expect more progress on that in the weeks ahead.” Mr. Biden’s aides have said throughout the year that the expect the current bout of inflation to fade quickly, as supply chain issues work themselves out and the world continues to emerge from the pandemic. Those predictions have frequently proven overly optimistic. But administration officials made another round of them this week ahead of the Labor Department release, saying they expected the drivers of inflation, like rising prices for used cars, to prove temporary and the rate of inflation to fall sharply in the first half of 2022. Administration officials also say they already see signs that other main drivers of price increases, like gasoline, are cooling off. Energy prices were up 33 percent from a year ago in the November report, and gasoline prices were up 58 percent. But the cost of a gallon at the pump began to fall in recent weeks, and so has the cost of natural gas. Republican lawmakers on Friday continued to point fingers at Mr. Biden for the rising costs and said Democrats would exacerbate inflation with their $2.2 trillion spending bill. “Senate Democrats should suspend any consideration of Biden’s inflation-driving Build Back Better spending binge until the president can demonstrate he can get inflation under control,” Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and ranking member on the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement. By Coral Murphy Marcos  S&P 500 - % Dow - % Nasdaq - % As of  Data delayed at least 15 minutes Source: FactSet Stocks on Wall Street jumped on Friday, with the S&P 500 on track for its best week since February, after inflation report that showed consumer prices were rising fast but was nevertheless in line with economists expectations. The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent in early trading, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1 percent. The S&P 500 has been rebounding this week, as concerns about the Omicron variant of the coronavirus eased somewhat even as it continues to spread. The benchmark index is poised to close the week with a gain of about 3 percent, within striking distance of a record.The gains on Friday came despite a Labor Department report that showed the Consumer Price Index rose at the fastest pace in nearly 40 years, up by 6.8 percent last month compared with a year earlier. The inflation measure rose 0.8 percent from October, which is a slightly slower rate in month-to-month increases. Officials at the Federal Reserve officials have been watching inflation data closely for the past several months, and signaled that the bank was ready to speed up its pullback on monetary policy stimulus that had helped support the economy since the pandemic started. The latest data adds to concerns that what was initially a burst of reopening-driven inflation could linger longer than policymakers first expected.Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, has said he expects central bank officials to address slowing bond purchases faster when they meet next week. Officials announced plans to slow those purchases by $15 billion a month, which would have the program ending midway through 2022. Ending those purchases would set the stage for interest rate increases, the Fed’s most powerful tool to cool down the economy. By Emma Goldberg  Better.com’s mercurial chief executive, Vishal Garg, faced swift backlash for his decision to fire more than 900 employees on a Zoom call last week. The mortgage lender’s board announced in a memo sent to staff on Friday that Mr. Garg was “taking time off” after the “very regrettable events.” “I come to you with not great news,” Mr. Garg had said to about 9 percent of his staff, in a recording since shared widely online. “If you’re on this call you are part of the unlucky group that is being laid off. Your employment here is terminated effective immediately.” Better.com, which is backed by SoftBank, has brought on a third-party firm to assess its leadership and culture, according to a copy of the board’s memo obtained by The New York Times. Several top employees resigned following the firings, two in communications and one in marketing. Better.com did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Christian Chapman, 41, a former underwriting trainer at Better.com, said he was used to preparing for company meetings by making sure his children weren’t around, because Mr. Garg tended to use foul language. But last Wednesday, when he received an unexpected invitation to the company call with Mr. Garg, he got a sense of foreboding because the chief executive looked so solemn. As Mr. Garg impassively delivered the news, Mr. Chapman said his “gut dropped to the floor,” and he tried to message teammates to ask what was happening but his computer access was shut off almost immediately. “I’ve been through layoffs and usually there’s closure because you talk to H.R., you go to your desk and grab your personal belongings and say goodbyes,” Mr. Chapman said. “There’s no closure here. You’re staring at an empty screen in your house.” It took about three hours for him to receive a follow-up email, reviewed by The Times, that explained the terms of the termination, Mr. Chapman added. On Thursday, the company increased his termination package from one to two months of pay. He also received a Christmas package containing a trophy, certificate and company T-shirt (which his wife offered to burn). Mr. Chapman said that the chief executive’s messaging about fired employees “stealing” from the company by working only two hours a day — which the former employee said was contradicted by his team’s recent promotions and raises — had made it challenging for them to apply for new jobs. Mr. Garg has apologized for his behavior on the Zoom call. In a memo dated Tuesday that was posted on the company’s site, Mr. Garg said he owned the choice to make layoffs but had “blundered” the approach. By Stanley Reed  An oil project off the coast of Scotland that had become a test of Britain’s environmental credentials was shelved by its main owner on Friday. The decision to halt Cambo, as the oil field is known, is a huge win for environmental groups like Greenpeace, and a blow to the North Sea oil industry. It comes just over a week after Shell, which owns 30 percent of the project, pulled out of the investment. “We are pausing the development while we evaluate next steps,” said Siccar Point Energy, a London-based company that is backed by private equity firms, including Blackstone, the financial management giant. Siccar Point said it had planned to invest $2.6 billion in Cambo, and had already spent $190 million on the field since acquiring it in 2017. The firm said that developing Cambo, a potentially valuable source of oil and natural gas, would have created 1,000 jobs. Environmental groups, on the other hand, said that starting new drilling projects was not compatible with Britain’s goals on tackling climate change and reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The British government has been considering whether to let Cambo go ahead. Located northwest of Scotland’s Shetland Islands, Cambo became a target of protests, including at the recent United Nations climate summit in Glasgow. Scotland’s top politician, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, has said she did not think it should be given a green light. On Dec. 2, Shell said it would not go ahead with investment because the economic case was not strong enough. Shell’s decision, which was also prompted by the potential for delays from protests and lawsuits, led Siccar Point to decide it could not “progress on the originally planned time scale,” the firm said. By Stephen Gandel  The U.S. stock market has been on a run, with the S&P 500 up nearly 4 percent so far this week, and more than 25 percent for the year. Fears about the Omicron variant of the coronavirus quickly faded, with stocks regaining lost ground. This makes some market watchers nervous, the DealBook newsletter reports, because of a metric that suggests that stock prices may be too high given the level of corporate earnings and rising inflation. The S&P 500 now has a real earnings yield — the inflation-adjusted ratio of earnings per share to the stock price — approaching negative 3 percent, the lowest since 1947, Bank of America equity strategists led by Savita Subramanian wrote in a recent note to clients. Negative yields are rare and often precede a stock market slump, the analysts wrote. A low earnings yield means that corporate profits are not keeping up with stock prices. And because real yields subtract inflation from the measure, a negative real earnings yield means that a company, based on its stock price, is not generating enough profits to keep up with rising prices. (Using October’s inflation number, Tesla’s real earnings yield is negative 5.2 percent.) The last time the S&P 500 had a negative real earnings yield, the Bank of America analysts said, was in 2000, before the tech bubble burst. It also happened twice during the stagflation of the 1970s and ’80s. This year, the S&P 500’s real earnings yield turned negative months ago, but it really sank recently as inflation has marched higher. Besides a bear market, there are two ways a negative earnings yield can turn positive: First, inflation would have to drop significantly, which some economists think is possible. Second, at a time when wages are rising and supply issues are interfering with plans, corporate profits could accelerate faster than expected. After the initial shock of the pandemic, stocks have shrugged off negative news and set a series of records. But the more that analysts consider the numbers, the more they worry that the gravity-defying rise may not last much longer. (Stocks fell on Thursday.) That said, “we live in a world where real negative rates are almost acceptable as a norm,” Ms. Subramanian noted. By Michael J. de la Merced  The Securities and Exchange Commission’s chair, Gary Gensler, has made clear for months that he is worried about the risks faced by investors in special purpose acquisition companies, which over the past two years have become a hugely popular way to take businesses public. In a speech on Thursday, he elaborated on one of the S.E.C.’s main focuses in reducing those risks — with measures that could shake up the industry, the DealBook newsletter reports. Mr. Gensler noted that SPACs are allowed to pitch potential investors using forward-looking business data that isn’t allowed in initial public offerings. That loophole, he said, allows the financiers behind these funds to release rosy-looking numbers that mask the underlying health of the business they’re taking public. (The S.E.C. has been looking into disclosure issues in SPAC deals involving the likes of Nikola and Lucid.) It now looks as if the S.E.C. may require SPACs to provide more complete disclosures about their deals, and to do so earlier: “It is essential that investors receive the information they need, when they need it, without misleading hype,” Mr. Gensler said. He also suggested that the people behind SPACs, including their sponsors, financial advisers and accountants, should be held more accountable for their due diligence on the companies these funds acquire, much as underwriters of I.P.O.s are. “Make no mistake: When it comes to liability, SPACs do not provide a ‘free pass’ for gatekeepers,” he said in his speech. The goal is to even out the playing field between SPACs and I.P.O.s. Deal makers have expected financial regulators to tighten the rules governing blank-check funds, amid an explosion in their popularity and the underperformance of many companies that have used them to go public, but Mr. Gensler’s comments shed further light on what that might look like. By Jack Ewing  Daimler’s car and truck divisions concluded an amicable divorce on Friday when shares in Daimler Truck began trading separately on the Frankfurt stock exchange. The separation of Mercedes-Benz, the luxury carmaker, from Daimler Truck, which owns Freightliner in the United States, signaled the end of an era not only for Daimler but also the German economy. The spinoff, announced in February, was the final chapter in a transition that began in the 1990s, when Daimler was a sprawling conglomerate that also made trains and passenger aircraft. Along with other industrial empires like Siemens, Daimler has been forced to jettison excess baggage to remain competitive. For car and truck makers, the need to ditch unwieldy corporate structures has become even more urgent as they try to survive the shift to emission-free propulsion. One justification for the spinoff is that it will allow Daimler Truck’s managers to make decisions more quickly. Daimler Truck is betting on hydrogen fuel cells for long-haul trucks, in contrast to competitors like Scania that favor batteries. It is not yet clear which technology will prevail. A few decades ago, many German companies operated on the principle that bigger was better. That might have made sense when capital was harder to come by, said Martin Daum, the chief executive of Daimler Truck, because the more profitable parts of a conglomerate could generate cash for struggling units. “We had globally very inefficient capital markets,” Mr. Daum said in an interview. “That supported the buildup of conglomerates.” “Today, every business that has a compelling idea can raise money,” he said. Whether Daimler Truck has compelling ideas will now be put to the test. The shares opened Friday at 28 euros (about $31.60) and rose as much as 8.5 percent, valuing the company at about $27 billion. The new company is the largest truck maker in the United States by way of its Freightliner brand. Globally, Daimler Truck is also the largest maker of buses. Its other brands include Mercedes-Benz trucks and buses sold primarily in Europe and Fuso trucks sold in Asia. Daimler Truck and Mercedes-Benz luxury cars will remain closely connected. Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes, will retain a 35 percent stake in Daimler Truck. The remaining shares will be distributed to Daimler shareholders. BNP Paribas, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs are serving as listing agents for the spinoff."

Because it is.  Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By David Leonhardt Offices remain eerily empty. Airlines have canceled thousands of flights. Subways and buses are running less often. Schools sometimes call off entire days of class. Consumers waste time waiting in store lines. Annual inflation has reached its highest level in three decades. Does this sound like a healthy economy to you? In recent weeks, economists and pundits have been asking why Americans feel grouchy about the economy when many indicators — like G.D.P. growth, stock prices and the unemployment rate — look strong. But I think the answer to this supposed paradox is that it’s not really a paradox: Americans think the economy is in rough shape because the economy is in rough shape. Sure, some major statistics look good, and they reflect true economic strengths, including the state of families’ finances. But the economy is more than a household balance sheet; it is the combined experience of working, shopping and interacting in society. Americans evidently understand the distinction: In an Associated Press poll, 64 percent describe their personal finances as good — and only 35 percent describe the national economy as good. There are plenty of reasons. Many services don’t function as well as they used to, largely because of supply-chain problems and labor shortages. Rising prices are cutting into paychecks, especially for working-class households. People spend less time socializing. The unending nature of the pandemic — the masks, Covid tests, Zoom meetings and anxiety-producing runny noses — is wearying. While some of these disruptions are minor inconveniences, others are causing serious troubles. The increase in social isolation has harmed both physical and mental health. Americans’ blood pressure has risen. Fatal drug overdoses have soared, with a growing toll among Black Americans. A report this week from the surgeon general found that depression, anxiety, impulsive behavior and attempted suicides had all risen among children and adolescents. “It would be a tragedy if we beat back one public health crisis only to allow another to grow in its place,” Dr. Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general, wrote. Schools are a particular source of frustration. Last year, the closure of in-person school caused large learning losses. This year, teachers have the near-impossible task of trying to help students make up for lost time, which has left many teachers feeling burned out. And school operations are still not back to normal. Students are sometimes forbidden to sit or talk with one another during lunch — or to eat indoors. Masks make communication harder, especially for students with learning disabilities. Positive Covid tests or worker shortages can cause schools to close temporarily. After Jennifer Reesman’s local school in Maryland closed for a day recently, she told NPR, “Our community can no longer count on the public schools.” As is often the case in our politically polarized era, the situation differs in red and blue America. In Republican-leaning communities, the biggest Covid problem remains a widespread refusal to take the pandemic seriously. About 40 percent of Republican adults have not received a vaccine shot, according to the most recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll. As a result, the Covid death rate is far higher in heavily Republican counties than in Democratic ones. Red America’s Covid denialism doesn’t seem to be abating, either. Fox News continues to spread disinformation, as Margaret Sullivan of The Washington Post has noted. Many Republican politicians spend more time complaining about mask and vaccine mandates than trying to persuade conservatives to get a potentially lifesaving shot. Blue America, by contrast, has taken Covid seriously. Fewer than 10 percent of Democratic voters have not received a vaccine shot. Political liberals also tend to be comfortable wearing masks to reduce the spread of the Covid virus. Yet many Democrats, both voters and politicians, have been almost blasé about the costs of Covid precautions — the isolation, unhappiness, health damage, lost learning, inflation, public-transit disruptions and more. Democrats have sometimes focused on minimizing the spread of Covid, regardless of the downsides: Closing schools, for example, almost certainly harms children more than it protects them, given the minuscule rate of severe childhood Covid, even lower than that of severe childhood flu. Consider this recent data from Gallup on the relative happiness and anxiety of Democratic and Republican voters: There are few easy solutions here because trade-offs are unavoidable. Although Covid presents relatively few risks to children and vaccinated adults under 50, it presents more to older people and some with specific immunodeficiencies. The current Covid surge has led to a modest rise in hospitalizations and deaths among the vaccinated and a much sharper rise among the unvaccinated. This surge justifies an increase in masking, testing and some other measures. But it’s worth remembering that the point of those measures is to maximize people’s health and well-being. And maximizing health and well-being is not the same thing as minimizing Covid. If that sounds strange, remember that society would cease to function if it tried to minimize every medical risk. Schools and offices don’t close each winter because of the flu. Families travel in cars even though crashes harm vastly more children than Covid does. People jog, play sports and ride bicycles even though thousands end up in emergency rooms. The economic and social costs of our Covid precautions are real. In some cases, those precautions are clearly worth it — and in other cases they’re not. Figuring out how to control the virus while addressing the other Covid-induced crises is one of the great challenges of the pandemic’s next phase. The F.D.A. authorized Pfizer boosters for 16- and 17-year-olds. In Afghanistan, the main problem appears to be too few vaccines; in Zambia, it’s more likely vaccine hesitancy or distribution.

Lina Wertmüller, the first woman nominated for an Oscar for directing, combined sexual warfare and leftist politics in films like “Swept Away” and “Seven Beauties.” She died at 93. The fandom of “Sex and the City,” a show that ended 17 years ago, never really died. Instagram accounts breathlessly document the characters’ outfits, and the show still inspires people to move to New York City (or at least fantasize about it). Combine that with ’90s and early-2000s nostalgia — in fashion and in sitcom reboots — and the return of “Sex and the City” seemed inevitable. “And Just Like That,” on HBO Max, premiered this week. The new version follows Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte, now in their 50s, though Kim Cattrall’s Samantha — the source of much of the original show’s sex — didn’t return. The show also features four new actors, and the cast is a contrast to the original show’s overwhelming whiteness. The spinoff has undergone other changes: Sarah Jessica Parker’s voice-over is mostly scrapped. Structurally, story arcs linger across episodes. Michael Patrick King, the showrunner of “And Just Like That,” recalled that when the show first aired, episodes tied up neatly because audiences might not have viewed them sequentially. “Streaming is like, untie the bow,” he said. The reviews are mixed. “There’s a bit of an Unfrozen 1990s Caveperson vibe to it all,” James Poniewozik writes in The Times.

8,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/12/10/world/covid-omicron-vaccines,Covid-19 Updates: Vaccine Mandates and Omicron News - The New York Times,12/10/2021,"The rule, which will go into effect in mid-March, comes as nations across Europe have reintroduced measures to curb a new surge in coronavirus cases.  A majority of Americans are critical of religious exemptions to Covid vaccines, a survey finds. Middlebury College in Vermont moves to remote instruction amid an outbreak. Britain faces an Omicron wave, but it’s not clear how bad it’ll be. Despite Austria’s virus surge, Salzburg Festival announces a program for next summer. Omicron brings new worries to British businesses. Denmark’s leader is questioned over a mink cull driven by Covid fears. German lawmakers voted on Friday to make Covid vaccines obligatory for health care workers — a significant move in a nation where protests against coronavirus restrictions have been widespread. The mandate, which will go into effect in mid-March, comes after the country last week announced a lockdown on those who are unvaccinated, and as nations across Europe have reintroduced measures meant to control the spread of the coronavirus. The efforts have taken on added urgency as scientists race to understand the risks posed by the recently detected Omicron variant. Although initial reports suggest Omicron spreads faster than previous variants, there are some early signs that it may cause mostly mild illness, but that observation was based mainly on cases in South Africa among younger people, who are generally less likely to become severely ill from Covid. There are also early indications that at least some vaccines will continue to work, though possibly at diminished levels. In Spain, which has some of the highest vaccination rates in Europe, the authorities warned on Friday that the situation was returning to a “high risk” level. Despite the country’s robust vaccination campaign, its infection rate has risen to levels not seen since August. And in Greece, to combat a rise in infections there, the government has imposed monthly fines of more than $100 for anyone over 60 who refuses to get vaccinated. Germany joins a number of European nations in mandating vaccination for health care workers, including France and Italy, which were among the first. Both countries have since gone even further in requiring proof of vaccination or negative tests for people to participate in much of public life. In November, the British government announced that all frontline health workers in England must be vaccinated against Covid-19 by the spring to keep their jobs. It is now considering more stringent restrictions across the nation for the unvaccinated. The Biden administration issued three mandates in September — one for federal contractors, another for health care workers and a third for companies with more than 100 employees. But the broad vaccine mandates affecting the private sector have been delayed by courts. Austria has gone the furthest of any Western democracy, requiring Covid vaccinations for all adults. But the World Health Organization has cautioned that mandates should be “an absolute last resort.” Dr. Hans Kluge, the W.H.O. director in Europe, told reporters this week that “any measure that might restrict a right or a movement of a person, such as lockdowns or mandates, needs to be sure that mental health and well-being is cared for.” Olaf Scholz, who was sworn in this week as the German chancellor, has prioritized combating the rising tide of infections in Germany. And he has expressed support for broad Covid vaccine mandates, even in the face of large-scale protests. “You can’t callously watch the situation as it is right now,” he recently told the German publication Bild. “If we had a higher vaccination rate, we would have a different situation.” Currently, health authorities are registering an average of just under 50,000 new infections every day. On Thursday, they registered nearly 500 deaths in a single day, a number not seen since before vaccines were made widely available. Hospitals are also under mounting pressure. There are now nearly 5,000 Covid patients in intensive care units, a number approaching the peak of the third pandemic wave in the spring, when politicians ordered a full lockdown. More than 69 percent of the German population is fully vaccinated, but the rate of daily vaccinations has recently increased to levels not seen since the early summer. Karl Lauterbach, the country’s newly anointed health minister, said the government was aiming to lower daily infection rates still driven by the Delta variant to levels that would make traveling around Christmas safe again. “We don’t have any time to lose,” said Mr. Lauterbach, a Harvard-trained epidemiologist and a public health expert. Under the new law, dentists and pharmacists will for the first time be allowed to administer Covid vaccines to bolster the national vaccination drive. But even as Germany introduced the mandate, Mr. Lauterbach said in an interview that no one would be jailed for refusing to get vaccinated. Those assurances, widely reported in the German news media, are unlikely to have a major effect on the tens of thousands of people who have been protesting both vaccine mandates and coronavirus restrictions. Last weekend, a mob bearing torches protested in front of the private residence of a state minister of health. This week, credible plans to attack Saxony’s premier were detailed on an anti-coronavirus channel on the messenger service Telegram and led to police raids in Saxony, where authorities found weapons. After meeting with governors on Thursday, the new chancellor, Mr. Scholz, was quick to play down any rifts over the restrictions and mandates. “Germany is not split,” he told reporters at a news conference. “The vast majority of citizens — very, very many — have been vaccinated.” Raphael Minder contributed reporting. — Christopher F. Schuetze and Marc Santora  Only about one in 10 Americans say that receiving the Covid-19 vaccine would violate their religious beliefs, while about 60 percent say that too many people are using religion as an excuse to avoid vaccine mandates, according to a new survey from the Public Religion Research Institute and the Interfaith Youth Core. A majority of Americans are critical of religious exemptions and say that the vaccines do not violate their own religious beliefs or the teachings of their religion, and that there are no valid religious reasons to refuse the Covid-19 vaccine. The survey indicates a sharp divide between vaccinated and unvaccinated Americans. That gap widens along partisan lines. More than 80 percent of vaccinated Democrats say they are angry at those who refuse to get vaccinated, and similar numbers of unvaccinated Republicans are “angry at those who think they have the right to tell me to get vaccinated against Covid-19.” Less than half of vaccinated Republicans and unvaccinated Democrats say they are angry along such lines. About one in five Americans say that vaccination has caused major conflict within their families. More than 200 million Americans — over 60 percent of the population — have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. The United States crossed that milestone on Wednesday as the threat of the Omicron variant spurred a flurry of jabs in recent days, though the daily rate remains far below its peak in April. And the United States lags significantly behind several other countries, which have inoculated over 80 percent of their populations. The Public Religion Research Institute survey focused on attitudes toward religious exemptions, a contentious topic amid sweeping vaccine mandates in American workplaces. No major religions or denominations oppose Covid vaccines, and many religious leaders have publicly endorsed them. In almost every religious group surveyed, more than half of respondents said that there were no religious reasons to refuse the Covid vaccine. White evangelical Protestants were the only exception: Just 41 percent agreed. White evangelical Protestants were also the only major religious group among whom a majority believed that “the government is not telling us about other treatments for Covid-19 that are just as effective as the vaccine.” About three in 10 unvaccinated Americans say they have already asked or plan to ask for an exemption from the vaccine because it goes against their religious values. Those numbers are higher among unvaccinated white evangelical Protestants and Protestants of color, about 40 percent of whom say they plan to or already have asked for religious exemptions. But even among those who said the vaccines violate their understanding of their religion’s teaching, more than four in 10 have already been vaccinated or intend to get a shot as soon as possible, said Robert P. Jones, chief executive officer and founder of the Public Religion Research Institute. “There’s not a one-to-one correlation,” Mr. Jones said. “That’s the way people live their lives: It’s messy, and there are other calculations.” The survey of more than 5,000 Americans was conducted in October and November. — Ruth Graham  Middlebury College, in Vermont, announced on Thursday night that it would move to remote instruction for the remainder of the semester as an outbreak grows. The college will hold final exams remotely. Administrators announced 34 new cases, bringing the total number of active cases reported to 50, the most on campus since the start of the pandemic. New restrictions are to begin Friday at 5 a.m. On-campus dining will transition to grab-and-go meals. All indoor events, athletic events and arts performances have been postponed. Officials urged students to limit indoor gatherings to six people. “While many of the new cases we have identified appear to be connected, occurring in clusters among people who socialize together, an increase in the prevalence of Covid-19 increases the likelihood of broader community transmission,” university officials wrote in a campuswide email obtained by The New York Times. While many colleges have mandated on-campus testing for all students, testing has remained optional this semester for most students at Middlebury, the student newspaper reported, although unvaccinated students and in-season varsity athletes who travel must meet testing requirements. Officials said 99 percent of the student body was fully vaccinated. Boosters will be required by mid-February. DePaul University, in Chicago, plans to start winter classes remote, after students travel for the winter break. Southern New Hampshire University will take similar measures. Both schools plan to maintain return to in-person teaching mid-January. Vermont is the most vaccinated state in the U.S., according to federal data: 74 percent of its population is fully vaccinated. But cases are rising, up 25 percent in the past two weeks. In Addison County, where Middlebury is, new cases have increased 56 percent over the past two weeks. Administrators urged Middlebury students to leave campus early. “Students who are able to depart for break or change plans without unreasonable complication or expense, should do so,” officials wrote in the email, sent to students at 7:55 p.m. on Thursday. The college is offering optional testing on Friday and Saturday. University officials said asymptomatic students would not need a test result to depart campus. “There’s a general creeping anxiety, both about our health and safety, but also about what it means for classes, finals, events, performances,” said Riley Board, 21, the editor in chief of the student newspaper, The Middlebury Campus. “If I had to predict how people will feel tomorrow, it will be this defeated end to the semester,” Ms. Board said. “Where we all have to leave slightly early and with the knowledge that something went wrong at the very end.” — Amelia Nierenberg  With cases of the Omicron variant doubling every three days and the government doing an about-face on restrictions it had long resisted, Britain is bracing for a new coronavirus surge, unsure if it will be a relatively minor event or a return to the dark days of earlier pandemic waves. So far, the number of Omicron cases — 817 confirmed by Thursday, though officials say the real figure is likely to be much higher — is small compared with the daily average of 48,000 new coronavirus cases overall. But the government’s Health Security Agency warned that if the recent growth rate continues, “we expect to see at least 50 percent of Covid-19 cases to be caused by the Omicron variant in the next two to four weeks.” Britain’s experience with Omicron may be a harbinger of what others can expect. Until now, it has been looser about social restrictions than many other nations in Western Europe, and Britain ordinarily has extensive travel to and from South Africa, so it could be the first wealthy country to be hit hard by Omicron. It also has one of the world’s most robust systems for sequencing viral genomes, so it can identify and track new variants earlier and more thoroughly than other countries. “I think we are looking at a horrible winter,” said Peter English, a retired consultant in communicable disease control, noting the exponential spread of Omicron. — Megan Specia  Austria went into lockdown recently to counter a record number of coronavirus cases. But in Salzburg, where the surge has been sharp, there are plans for a brighter future. On Friday the Salzburg Festival, classical music and opera’s most storied annual event, announced its 2022 summer season — back to prepandemic scale, with more than 200 events over six weeks beginning July 18. There is a rich lineup of opera, spoken drama, orchestra concerts — many featuring the festival’s house band, the Vienna Philharmonic — and recitals, including the usual enviable array of pianists. Buoyed by government subsidies and sponsorship deals, Salzburg has been able to weather the pandemic, putting on a fairly robust season in 2020 for limited audiences and returning to something akin to normal in 2021. The commemoration of the centennial of the festival, which was established in 1920, ended up being spread over the past two years. — Zachary Woolfe  For months, businesses across Britain have been desperately trying to maneuver around supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and rising costs as they emerged from various stages of lockdown. Offices reopened, which filled up commuter buses and trains; restaurants and pubs advertised to host holiday parties; and lines grew longer at city center coffee shops. Now, the emergence of the fast-spreading Omicron variant has unexpectedly dealt those efforts a blow. The government has revived coronavirus restrictions that are likely to weigh on hospitality and travel businesses during the critical holiday season and put a dent in the economy. In England beginning Friday, face masks will be required in most indoor public places including cinemas and theaters. Starting Monday, people who can work from home should. And starting in the middle of next week, passes showing vaccination or a recent negative Covid test will be required for large events and nightclubs, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced this week.  “Unless you go to a full or partial lockdown, the effect of the measures themselves will be rather small,” said Paul Mortimer-Lee, the deputy director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in London. “What will be hurting the economy is individuals’ responses.” People are likely to take more precautions to protect themselves from the virus, especially by socializing less. While the rules are relatively light, for some businesses this will be an unwelcome retreat. And there are early indications that restaurant reservations are declining and Christmas parties are being canceled. — Eshe Nelson  A government decision last year to cull all of Denmark’s 17 million minks for fear that infected animals could transmit the coronavirus to humans prompted a huge outcry in the country, which until then was the world’s top exporter of the high-quality mink skins commonly used in fur coats. On Thursday, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was grilled by a parliamentary commission about the decision last year by her government, which resulted in the loss of 5,000 jobs in Denmark — and also turned out to be illegal. Testifying on Thursday before the commission investigating the decision to cull the minks, Ms. Frederiksen denied knowing at the time that the government lacked the legal authority to order the slaughter of the entire population of the animals. She testified, as she has said before, that she was not made aware of the legal problem until Nov. 8, 2020, four days after she announced the government’s decision. The government later acknowledged that it had legal powers only to order the killing of infected animals, not healthy ones. The situation became a political crisis and prompted the minister of agriculture to resign. Parliament has appointed an independent three-member commission to investigate the matter. If the commission concludes that the prime minister did not tell the truth about the legal questions, she could face impeachment. — Thomas Erdbrink and Jasmina Nielsen"

Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Eshe Nelson LONDON — On Thursday morning, a group of 50 called to cancel their holiday party booked for that evening at Luc’s Brasserie, a French restaurant in the financial district of Britain’s capital. That same morning, a group of 21 canceled their party too, also for Thursday night. The previous night, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that stricter Covid measures were coming, and the impact was immediate for Darrin Jacobs, the owner of Luc’s. There had been a “multitude of cancellations,” he said. But thanks to a waiting list of reservations, he said, the restaurant was still fully booked until Christmas. And many of the canceled bookings had optimistically rescheduled their celebrations for early next year. “We won’t lose the business, we’ll just move the business on,” Mr. Jacobs said. But “it’s not easy because we’ve already bought food and moved staff around,” he said. For months, businesses across Britain have been desperately trying to maneuver around supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and rising costs as they emerged from various stages of lockdown. Offices reopened, which filled up commuter buses and trains; restaurants and pubs advertised to host holiday parties; and lines grew longer at city center coffee shops. Now, the emergence of the fast-spreading Omicron variant has unexpectedly dealt those efforts a blow. The government has revived coronavirus restrictions that are likely to weigh on hospitality and travel businesses during the critical holiday season and put a dent in the economy. “I don’t know where this is going to go next week,” Mr. Jacobs said. “I think this is a tip of the iceberg-type scenario and it may get a lot worse next week and, if that’s the case, we’ll really have to scale it back.” For now, he’s still cautiously optimistic. But his business relies on people who work in nearby offices and walk to his restaurant in Leadenhall Market, especially several insurance companies. On Thursday, Mr. Jacobs heard that two large companies were closing their offices again. In England beginning Friday, face masks will be required in most indoor public places including cinemas and theaters. Starting Monday, people who can work from home should. And starting in the middle of next week, passes showing vaccination or a recent negative Covid test will be required for large events and nightclubs, Mr. Johnson announced this week. The rules will be voted on in Parliament next week. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have set their own measures, which are slightly stricter. “Unless you go to a full or partial lockdown, the effect of the measures themselves will be rather small,” said Paul Mortimer-Lee, the deputy director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in London. “What will be hurting the economy is individuals’ responses.” People are likely to take more precautions to protect themselves from the virus, especially by socializing less. While the rules are relatively light, for some businesses this will be an unwelcome retreat. Before the Omicron variant was discovered, the British economy was losing some momentum while prices were rising rapidly, putting inflation at its highest level in nearly a decade. Gross domestic product grew 1.3 percent in the third quarter, down from 5.5 percent in the previous three months. And that growth was driven by spending on services, especially in hotels, restaurants and entertainment as the last of the major pandemic restrictions were lifted in the summer. In October, economic expansion slowed sharply, to just 0.1 percent from the previous month. Now, there are early indications that restaurant reservations are declining and Christmas parties are being canceled. Restaurants, cafes and shops primarily serving office workers were contending with the lost trade from hybrid working but had at least seen a notable return of workers. Some 70 percent of British workers said they had traveled to work at least some days each week in early December, according to the Office for National Statistics, up from about 50 percent earlier in the year, when the country was under a strict lockdown. Sales at Pret A Manger, the coffee and sandwich chain whose shops tend to be clustered around office hubs and transport locations, only returned to prepandemic levels about two weeks ago. Now those sales are starting to slip again. “Christmas has been canceled for many City shops, restaurants, pubs and other businesses that rely on footfall from workers in nearby offices,” Catherine McGuinness, the policy chairwoman of the City of London Corporation, which governs the capital’s financial district, said in a statement. Her organization will encourage workers and businesses to follow the new rules but said the government needed to lay out a road map for lifting the restrictions again in the new year, Ms. McGuinness said. The new measures will also complicate the next steps for the Bank of England. Policymakers at the central bank had been preparing to raise interest rates in response to inflation, provided unemployment remained low. Some analysts believed an increase could come as soon as next week. But the potential for Omicron to further slow the economy makes it harder to justify tightening monetary policy. The extra uncertainty could dampen productivity and employment growth, according to Mr. Mortimer-Lee. It’s likely to make companies more cautious about hiring and investment, especially businesses that rely on face-to-face interactions, like restaurants. Also, high case numbers will keep children out of schools and parents away from their jobs. “It’s those millions of individual decisions, rather than Boris Johnson’s decision, that’s going to affect the economy,” said Mr. Mortimer-Lee. “And none of it’s going to be good.” Even before the latest measures, hotels were seeing about a fifth of their corporate bookings canceled, according to UKHospitality, an industry lobby group, after the government required travelers into Britain to take a Covid test within two days of arriving, and isolate until receiving the results. Christmas bookings weren’t as strong as they traditionally are for hospitality businesses in a quarter that usually brings in about 40 percent of the industry’s annual revenue. And so, the industry is asking for relief from business rates (a type of tax on commercial properties), more grants, rent protection and an extension of the reductions on VAT, a sales tax. “Anything less would prove catastrophic,” Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UKHospitality, said in a statement. The latest measures have been particularly disappointing for nightclubs, one of the last businesses allowed to reopen earlier this year. The Night Time Industries Association said Covid passes have been damaging to their industry in the parts of Britain where they were already in place. Michael Kill, the chief executive of the lobbying group, said businesses were experiencing a “honeymoon period” since reopening in the summer and were trying to rebuild cash reserves before the quieter months at the start of the year. “We’re now seeing some concern around cancellations and ticket purchases hesitancy,” Mr. Kill said. “These sorts of things that are leaving people in a vulnerable position, because many of them stocked up and purchased and staffed for a busy Christmas period.” The group accused the government of enacting the changes to draw attention away from public fury over accusations that the prime minister’s staff broke lockdown rules by holding an office party last Christmas. “It feels that nightclubs and bars have been thrown under the bus by the prime minister for him to save his own skin,” Mr. Kill said in a statement on Wednesday.

And a politician is questioning why 850 titles are on library shelves. The result: “A lot of our teachers are petrified.” Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Michael Powell SAN ANTONIO — In late September, Carrie Damon, a middle school librarian, celebrated “Banned Books Week,” an annual free-speech event, with her working-class Latino students by talking of literature’s beauty and subversive power. A few weeks later, State Representative Matt Krause, a Republican, emailed a list of 850 books to superintendents, a mix of half-century-old novels — “The Confessions of Nat Turner” by William Styron — and works by Ta-Nehisi Coates and Margaret Atwood, as well as edgy young adult books touching on sexual identity. Are these works, he asked, on your library shelves? Mr. Krause’s motive was unclear, but the next night, at a school board meeting in San Antonio, parents accused a librarian of poisoning young minds. Days later, a secretary sidled up to Ms. Damon and asked if district libraries held pornography. “‘No, no, honey, we don’t buy porno,’” Ms. Damon replied. She sighed. “I don’t need my blood pressure going crazy worrying about ending up on a politician’s radar.” Texas is afire with fierce battles over education, race and gender. What began as a debate over social studies curriculum and critical race studies — an academic theory about how systemic racism enters the pores of society — has become something broader and more profound, not least an effort to curtail and even ban books, including classics of American literature. In June, and again in recent weeks, Texas legislators passed a law shaping how teachers approach instruction touching on race and gender. And Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican with presidential ambitions, took aim at school library shelves, directing education officials to investigate “criminal activity in our public schools involving the availability of pornography.” “Parents are rightfully angry,” he wrote in a separate letter. They “have the right to shield their children from obscene content.” Such upheaval surprises few. Public schools are where a society transmits values and beliefs, and this fraught and deeply divided time has again made a cauldron of public education. “Education is not above the fray; it is the fray,” said Robert Pondiscio, a former teacher and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a public policy group. “It’s naïve to think otherwise.” In Texas, conservative slates have claimed majorities on school boards in large suburban districts, including Southlake, near Dallas, and Cypress-Fairbanks, near Houston. In Colleyville, a tony suburb near Dallas, a Black principal resigned, accused of sanctioning the teaching of critical race theory. Elsewhere, books have been pulled from library shelves and talks by award-winning writers canceled. How this ends is unclear. To talk with a dozen teachers and librarians is to hear annoyance and frustration and bewilderment, as much with the sheer ambiguity of the new law and the list of books as with the practical effect. “Critical race theory is a convenient boogeyman, but what are the limits you want to put on teachers?” said Joe Cohn, legislative director for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a civil liberties organization. “Do you really want to give them no breathing room? Do you want to shut down a curious student? Legislatures would be wise to be modest.” From debates over evolution to the Red Scare to the Vietnam War, America’s public schools are a much-trodden battleground. In the 1990s, the New York City chancellor, after much controversy, was forced to remove mention of the book “Heather Has Two Mommies” from the curriculum; more recently, a liberal California school district ruled that “Of Mice and Men” and “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” were racially insensitive and no longer mandatory reading. In Texas, such battles recur. In 2018, an education committee proposed striking a reference to “heroic” defenders of the Alamo, describing it as a “value-laden word.” A roar of resistance arose and the board of education rejected the proposal. The Republican lieutenant governor this year pressured a museum to cancel a panel to discuss a revisionist book — “Forget the Alamo” — examining its slaveholding combatants. The last year was particularly contentious. “One minute they’re talking critical race theory,” Ms. Damon, the librarian, said. “Suddenly I’m hearing librarians are indoctrinating students.” Mr. Krause, who compiled the list of 850 books that might “make students feel discomfort, guilt, anguish” because of race or sex, did not respond to interview requests. Nor did his aides explain why he drew up the list, which includes a book on gay teenagers and book banning, “The Year They Burned the Books” by Nancy Garden; “Quinceañera,” a study of the Latina coming-of-age ritual by the Mexican Jewish academic Ilan Stavans; and a particularly puzzling choice, “Cynical Theories” by Helen Pluckrose and James Lindsay, which is deeply critical of leftist academic theorizing, including critical race theory. But his hazily defined list of troublesome books seems to have sent a chill through school boards. Absent any state law, some librarians have been told to pre-emptively pull down books. This week, a San Antonio district ordered 400 books taken off its shelves for a review. As for the state’s attempt to ban critical race theory, for all the Republicans’ talk, the Texas law makes no mention of the term. Aspects of critical race theory are influential in some teacher colleges, and shape how some administrators and teachers approach race and ideas of white privilege. Yet no one has identified a Texas high school class that teaches the theory. Perhaps as a result, the statute’s language can be ambiguous to the point of vagueness. In its central thrust, the law sounds a seemingly unobjectionable note, ruling no particular subject — slavery, Reconstruction, the treatment of Native Americans — out of bounds and stating that teachers should “explore” contentious subjects “in a manner free from political bias.” Sarah Spurrier, a teacher in Arlington, is not enamored of the law but neither is she intimidated. “I’ve taught A.P. social studies and geography for 21 years so there’s not much that makes me uncomfortable,” she said. “This law is so vague that it strikes me as much ado about nothing.” Others see peril, particularly in conservative districts where teachers step lightly for fear of giving offense. Emerson Sykes, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, has helped challenge an Oklahoma law that is similar to Texas’. That federal suit argues that the law is so vague that it fails to provide reasonable legal guidance to teachers and could put jobs in danger. He also spoke to another motivation. “For generations we had a whitewashed history,” Mr. Sykes said. “We view these as bans on inclusive history.” The Texas law does state that teachers should not inculcate a sense of guilt or discomfort in students because of their race or sex. On the question of slavery, for instance, the Texas law prohibits teachers from portraying slavery and racism as “anything other than deviations from, betrayals of, or failures to live up to the authentic founding principles of the United States.” This conflicts with the views of many scholars who note that from America’s founding, slavery was woven into the structure of the nation and the Constitution. The law singles out one text as forbidden: The New York Times’s 1619 Project. Now a book, the special magazine issue attempted to place Black Americans and the consequences of slavery at the center of America’s narrative. The project — for which Nikole Hannah-Jones, its creator, won a Pulitzer Prize — is hotly debated among historians and became an ideological piñata for conservative critics. State Representative Steve Toth, who sponsored the bill against critical race theory, declined an interview. But several critics of the 1619 Project strongly opposed banning it. An <U+200B><U+200B>expansive academic framework. Critical race theory, or C.R.T, argues that historical patterns of racism are ingrained in law and other modern institutions. The theory says that racism is a systemic problem, not only a matter of individual bigotry. C.R.T. is not new. Derrick Bell, a pioneering legal scholar who died in 2011, spent decades exploring what it would mean to understand racism as a permanent feature of American life. He is often called the godfather of critical race theory, but the term was coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw in the 1980s. The theory has gained new prominence. After the protests born from the police killing of George Floyd, critical race theory resurfaced as part of a backlash among conservatives — including former President Trump — who began to use the term as a political weapon. The current debate. Critics of C.R.T. argue that it accuses all white Americans of being racist and is being used to divide the country. But critical race theorists say they are mainly concerned with understanding the racial disparities that have persisted in institutions and systems. A hot-button issue in schools. The debate has turned school boards into battlegrounds as some Republicans say the theory is invading classrooms. Education leaders, including the National School Boards Association, say that C.R.T. is not being taught in K-12 schools. “It’s just enormously problematic to rule out particular works,” said Frederick Hess of the American Enterprise Institute, who has written favorably of the battles against critical race theory. “I happen to think ‘1619’ is a shoddy work, but so what? Let kids read critiques and wrestle with it.” Stanley Kurtz, a senior fellow with the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, crafted the model that led to the Texas statute. He declined an interview, but in The National Review, he opposed blocking teaching of the 1619 Project. “We should not be barring the discussion or understanding of concepts, only the teaching of them as truths to be embraced,” he wrote. What are schools and teachers to make of these crosscurrents? Southlake, a wealthy suburb near Dallas, offers a petri dish. Racist incidents led previous trustees to embrace racial diversity teachings. The killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 gave birth to a more insistent movement of young alumni who demanded students address white privilege and have every teacher and school trustee examined for implicit bias. The school trustees did not endorse such demands. But a movement of parents who described themselves as “unapologetically rooted in Judeo-Christian values” rose up and in May elected a like-minded majority. That board recently reprimanded a fourth-grade teacher — a former teacher of the year — after parents complained that their child brought home a classroom book about racism that troubled them. A curriculum official went so far as to suggest teachers should seek “opposing” perspectives if students read a book on the Holocaust, according to a recording acquired by NBC News. The superintendent apologized. “We recognize,” he stated, “there are not two sides to the Holocaust.” Sheri Mills, a Southlake school trustee, heard herself denounced as a Marxist and heckled at her teenage daughter’s athletic events. “A lot of our teachers are petrified,” Ms. Mills said. “The really good teachers, if they are near retirement, they are leaving.” In Alief, a diverse district on the western edge of Houston, three English teachers at Kerr High School sat together and spoke of this uncertain world. Safraz Ali, who spent his early boyhood in Guyana and had taught for 17 years, said he had grown weary of the uncertainty. He called the state education department and asked officials to define critical race theory. He received no answer. “It’s like you’re walking into a dark room,” he said. The teachers pointed in particular to the clause that says a teacher must not inculcate the idea that students should feel “responsibility, blame or guilt” because of their race or sex. Mr. Krause, the state representative, had gone a step further, suggesting that a teacher might overstep simply by assigning a book that troubles a student. These teachers all but slapped foreheads in frustration. To teach Shakespeare and Toni Morrison, to read Gabriel García Márquez or Frederick Douglass, is to elicit swells of emotions, they said, out of which can arise introspection and self-recognition, sorrow and joy. The challenge is no different for a social studies teacher talking of Cherokee dying along the Trail of Tears or white gangs lynching Black and Mexican people. “I have had kids triggered by difficult texts,” noted Ayn Nys, one of the English teachers. “It’s our responsibility to prepare students emotionally and intellectually with a diversity of voices.” How does this end? “OK, you ban a book — does that ban the topic?” Kathleen Harrison, another teacher, said while shaking her head. “At what point do I practice subversion?” Adrian Reyna, a social studies teacher at Longfellow Middle School in San Antonio, did not fear that, not yet. “Truthfully, I have not changed a single thing about my teaching,” he said. His school feeds into Thomas Jefferson High School. His students know Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence. Mr. Reyna helped them to understand that the third president kept slaves and had children with an enslaved woman, Sally Hemings. “Jefferson did some really great things and some ugly, and we don’t throw that away,” he said. “We know human beings are complex, and that is the story of America.” Mr. Pondiscio, the American Enterprise Institute education analyst, is critical of aspects of the liberal educational project. He sees antiracist education, such as grouping students in racial affinity groups, as lapsing into parody. Teachers may bridle, he says, but free speech is curtailed in a public school classroom. Yet he sees futility woven into efforts to dictate curriculum. He once taught in an impoverished corner of the South Bronx in New York, and although his politics differ from those of Mr. Reyna, each knows what it is like for a teacher to try to fire the minds of teenagers. Both spoke of the hope a teacher can provoke without placing a thumb heavily on the ideological scales. “Every day, teachers call audibles at the line of scrimmage, figuring out what materials and words will work,” Mr. Pondiscio said. “It betrays arrogance to think you’re going to solve all the problems of schools and race by passing a curriculum law.” Advertisement"

But if the extradition goes ahead, he would face espionage charges that could put him in prison for decades. Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Megan Specia and Charlie Savage LONDON — A British court ruled on Friday that Julian Assange can be extradited to the United States to face charges that could result in decades of jail time, reversing a lower-court decision in the long-running case against the embattled WikiLeaks founder. The ruling was a victory, at least for now, for the Biden administration, which has pursued an effort to prosecute Mr. Assange begun under the Trump administration. But Mr. Assange will seek to appeal the decision to Britain’s Supreme Court, according to his legal team. The Justice Department’s decision to charge Mr. Assange under the Espionage Act in connection with obtaining and publishing secret government documents has raised novel First Amendment issues and alarmed advocates of media freedom. But because he has been fighting extradition, those questions have not been litigated and his transfer to the United States could set off a momentous constitutional battle. The extradition case in Britain has not turned on whether the charges against Mr. Assange are legitimate — a lower-court judge ruled they were — but on whether prison conditions in the United States are too harsh for his mental health. In ruling that Mr. Assange can be extradited, the High Court in London said it that was satisfied by assurances provided by the Biden administration that it would not hold him under the most austere conditions reserved for high-security prisoners and that, if he were to be convicted, it would let him serve his sentence in his native Australia if he requested it. The U.S. Justice Department media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But an American lawyer for Mr. Assange, Barry J. Pollack, denounced the ruling, calling it “disturbing” that the British court accepted the American government’s “vague assurances” of humane treatment. “The U.K. court reached this decision without considering whether extradition is appropriate when the United States is pursuing charges against him that could result in decades in prison, based on his having reported truthful information about newsworthy issues such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,” he said. Mr. Assange fled into the Ecuadorean Embassy in London in 2012 when he was facing an investigation on allegations of sexual assault in Sweden, which were eventually dropped. He said he feared his human rights would be violated if he was extradited in that case. He remained in the embassy for seven years until he was ejected in 2019. The United States unsealed an indictment against him on hacking charges on the day of his expulsion, and then charged him under the Espionage Act weeks later. He has been detained in London’s Belmarsh prison since 2019. The complex case against Mr. Assange centers on his 2010 publication of diplomatic and military files leaked by Chelsea Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst — not on his publication during the 2016 election of Democratic emails stolen by Russia. Over the course of three indictments developed during the Trump administration, prosecutors have made two sets of accusations. The first is that Mr. Assange participated in a criminal hacking conspiracy, both by offering to help Ms. Manning mask her tracks on a secure computer network and by engaging in a broader effort to encourage hackers to obtain secret material and send it to WikiLeaks. The other is that his solicitation and publication of information the government deemed secret violated the Espionage Act. Hacking is not a journalistic act. But the second set of charges could establish a precedent that journalistic-style activities, like seeking and publishing information the government considers classified, may be treated as a crime in the United States — a separate question from whether Mr. Assange himself counts as a journalist. In January, a lower court judge rejected the extradition request on the grounds that Mr. Assange might be driven to suicide by American prison conditions. On Jan. 19, in one of its last acts, the Trump administration filed an appeal. Soon after taking office, the Biden administration decided to press forward with the effort. The court ruling on Friday said the decision to allow the extradition was based on a number of assurances from the United States, including that Mr. Assange would receive any necessary psychological treatment and that if convicted, he would not be held at the country’s only federal supermax prison — the highest security facility, which houses the nation’s worst criminals. Several doctors have said that Mr. Assange suffers from depression and memory loss and could attempt suicide if he were extradited, an argument that was central in his case. Mr. Assange’s fiancé, Stella Moris, said in a statement that he would be appealing at the “earliest possible moment” and called Friday’s decision a “grave miscarriage of justice.” Ms. Moris and Mr. Assange have two children, conceived during the seven years he was hiding out in the Ecuadorean embassy in London. Kristinn Hrafnsson, the editor in chief of WikiLeaks, denounced the court’s ruling and warned that Mr. Assange’s life “is once more under grave threat, and so is the right of journalists to publish material that governments and corporations find inconvenient.” He added, “This is about the right of a free press to publish without being threatened by a bullying superpower.” Activists who gathered outside the courthouse in central London erupted in protest after the news of the decision filtered outside. And rights groups were quick to condemn the move. Christophe Deloire, the head of Reporters Without Borders, said in a statement that his group believed Mr. Assange “has been targeted for his contributions to journalism, and we defend this case because of its dangerous implications for the future of journalism and press freedom around the world.” He added, “It is time to put a stop to this more than decade-long persecution once and for all.” Jameel Jaffer, the executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, who testified in the extradition proceeding about the implications of the indictment for media freedom, reiterated “profound concerns” about the case in a statement responding to the ruling. The indictment, he said, focused in large part on activities that investigative journalists engage in routinely. “The message of the indictment is that these activities are not just unprotected by the First Amendment but criminal under the Espionage Act,” he said. “The Trump administration should never have filed this indictment, and we call on the Biden administration again to withdraw it.” Advertisement"

Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Carlotta Gall ANKARA, Turkey — President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sat for an interview on national television late last month, apparently seeking to calm nerves about Turkey’s weakening currency and galloping inflation. But the reaction has been anything but calm. He insisted there was “no turning back” on his newly announced economic plan, which has promoted policies that seem aimed at defying the laws of economic gravity, like refusing to tick up interest rates to combat rising prices and buttress the value of his currency. “Interest rates make the rich richer, the poor poorer,” he said. “We have prevented our country being crushed in such a way. We will not allow this.” Turkey’s currency, the lira, began sliding virtually as he spoke, capping a day in which it lost 8 percent of its value. It has hardly stopped plunging since mid-November, hitting new lows every few days. Turks have watched staple goods double in price and fuel costs jump by 40 percent. Mr. Erdogan’s interview on TRT cost the country billions of lira in just two hours, the opposition Republican People’s Party spokesman, Faik Oztrak, commented. “TRT’s show with Erdogan tonight was the most expensive production in TRT history,” he said on Twitter. A former prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, called on the president to stop. “For God’s sake don’t talk anymore!” he tweeted. But Mr. Erdogan keeps talking — and rattling markets and eroding confidence in the lira and his stewardship of Turkey — as he doubles down on a policy prescription that few if any economists agree with and that has left suffering Turks and others wondering why he is doing what he’s doing. Mr. Erdogan has been in power for nearly two decades, with much of his political success built on nearly continuous economic growth that has lifted millions of Turks into the middle class. Facing re-election in 18 months, he is sliding in opinion polls, largely because of the deteriorating economy. His focus is how to turn around the decline in time to boost his election chances. “He is trying to keep the boat afloat in his own way,” said Akif Beki, who served as chief adviser to Mr. Erdogan when he was prime minister. “He believes that he can turn things around and he can convince people again when elections come closer.” But for now, markets and analysts agree, his medicine is making what ails Turkey worse, and Mr. Erdogan has become increasingly isolated in his economic plan, having narrowed his circle of advisers since his early days as he gathered up virtually authoritarian power for himself. In particular, Mr. Erdogan’s switch to a strong presidential system in 2018 has made him more reliant on a small inner circle rather than the wider scope of party officials and elected politicians under the earlier parliamentary system. That has given rise to criticism that he is surrounded by yes-men and increasingly detached from the electorate — and economic realities. Mr. Erdogan has replaced a series of Central Bank chiefs and finance ministers in recent years, confident that he knows the economy better than any of them and reasoning that by controlling monetary policy he could make decisions more efficiently. “He is not listening to the economists which is typical of strongmen,” said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the director of the Ankara office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. The president, he added, was “increasingly less tolerant of dissent, particularly from within the party.” Indeed, what exasperates many, in businesses large and small, is that Mr. Erdogan is not speaking off the cuff or dropping comments inadvertently. He and his insular team in the presidency, squired by his attentive communications director Fahrettin Altun, have been rolling out prepared speeches, which he delivers live on national television with the aid of a teleprompter. In his first speech two weeks ago, he expounded at length on his decision to go against most Western economic practice and instead follow China in lowering interest rates and driving down the national currency to balance out Turkey’s current account deficit and make its products more attractive for export. He called on Turkish citizens to prepare for a “historic struggle” in what he cast as an “economic war of independence.” He vowed that the country would no longer have to surrender to high interest rates, inflation and currency traps and he promised to improve production, employment and clear the current account deficit. “Turkey may for the first time in its history have the opportunity to follow an economic policy in line with its own needs and realities,” he said. The lira began a free fall within hours of his speech, losing 15 percent of its value in one day. Undeterred Mr. Erdogan gave another speech the next day and several more since, each time reaffirming his determination to lower interest rates in pursuit of growth. He has reacted to the price increases not by adjusting his own approach but by lashing out at suppliers and warning them not to hoard goods and pressuring supermarkets to keep prices down. Social media was alive Thursday with talk of price increases for toilet paper and milk products. “I am stunned by the increases,” said Mehmet Eraltay, who was selling bagels from a cart on the capital’s main square Wednesday. “It think the end of the world is coming.” Analysts struggled to explain what has prompted Mr. Erdogan to insist on a monetary policy that goes against most widely accepted economic practice of controlling inflation by raising interest rates. “The only thing that is going on now is the upcoming elections,” said Mr. Unluhisarcikli, of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. Mr. Erdogan is sliding in the polls, largely because of the economy, and is seeking to regain the momentum ahead of elections in 2023, he said. “He is looking for a way out.” Most economists say the Chinese example would take a decade to take effect and could not bring economic relief within six to eight months as Mr. Erdogan is promising. Mr. Erdogan is also constrained by his political ally, Devlet Bahceli, the right-wing leader of the Nationalist Movement Party, who frequently applies the brakes to proposals by Mr. Erdogan that would improve Turkey’s international standing. Even limited efforts to restore democratic institutions and the independence of the judiciary could go some way to answer investors’ concerns, Mr. Unluhisarcikli said. It could also help Mr. Erdogan’s standing with voters, who are feeling increasingly anxious and ignored. One of the few polling consultants who continues to advise both Mr. Erdogan and his opponents, Mehmet Ali Kulat, said he had to deliver uncomfortable news in their most recent meeting. His most recent survey found that around 60 percent of respondents were very uncomfortable with the economic situation and 41 percent said they could not meet their essential needs. There is widespread distrust of government institutions and even anger in reactions of respondents to some questions, Mr. Kulat said. “This is something beyond politics.” Yet the president, who is known to closely follow opinion polls, dismissed the poor results and insisted he would still win, Mr. Kulat said. “Mr. Erdogan believes the data about the economy that we and other pollsters give is exaggerated,” he said. The leader of an Islamist party, Temel Karamollaoglu, who met with Mr. Erdogan in November, also described the president as dismissive of his concerns. “Mr. President believes that all developments in the economy and foreign policy are fail-safe,” he said in an interview published in an online news outlet, Gazete Duvar. “He doesn’t see any problem. I told him, ‘The information coming to you may be mistaken or different.’ He doesn’t share that idea.” But Mr. Beki, the former adviser, said Mr. Erdogan would be focused on preventing the spread of bad news rather than questioning it. “He believes he knows best,” he said. “I don’t think he listens to advice.” Advertisement"

Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Oscar Lopez MEXICO CITY — At least 54 people were killed and more than 100 injured in a horrific truck accident in southern Mexico on Thursday, the authorities said, with most of the victims believed to be migrants coming from Central America. The accident, which took place in southern Chiapas State, occurred when a truck carrying over 100 people overturned on Thursday afternoon near Tuxtla Gutiérrez, the capital, the head of the state Civil Protection Service, Luis Manuel García Moreno, told Milenio TV. The accident is one of the deadliest involving migrants in decades, and follows the death of 13 migrants in a car accident on the U.S. border in March. Mr. García said that based on witness testimony, the truck was traveling at excessive speed and then flipped over while rounding a sharp curve, with the trailer carrying the migrants then crashing into a pedestrian bridge and construction nearby. Images and video shared on social media showed more than a dozen bodies laid out on the road covered in white sheets near what appeared to be the twisted remains of an overturned vehicle. The state’s governor, Rutilio Escandón, said on Twitter that 105 people had been injured in the crash. The accident occurred on the highway between the town of Chiapa de Corzo and the state capital. “My solidarity with the victims of the traffic accident,” he said in another tweet. “I have given instructions to provide prompt attention and assistance to the injured. Responsibility will be determined according to the law.” Bordering Guatemala, the state of Chiapas has in recent years seen a surge of migrants from Central America, many of them being smuggled through Mexico on their way to the United States border. A record 1.7 million migrants, mainly from Mexico and Central America, were found trying to enter the United States illegally in the 12 months leading up to October this year. Attempting to reach the United States, whether to seek asylum or to search for economic opportunities, is a dangerous and at times deadly process, with migrants traveling through cartel-infested territory in northern Mexico, often paying steep prices to smugglers to get them to the border. Migrants are regularly packed into trucks or cars as they make the journey north, and frequently fall prey to violence along the way. In January, the bodies of 19 people, most of them migrants, were found in a charred pickup truck near the U.S. border. Twelve police officers were later arrested in connection with the crime. At least 3,575 deaths have been documented on the United States-Mexico border since 2014, according to the International Organization for Migration, with 650 people killed attempting to cross the U.S. border this year alone — the highest number since the agency began documenting deaths in 2014. “The rising migrant death toll in the region is highly alarming,” Michele Klein-Solomon, the organization’s regional director for Central, North America and the Caribbean, said in a statement on Wednesday. At least 750 migrants have been killed trying to cross Mexico since 2014, according to the agency, and thousands more have simply disappeared. Thursday’s accident occurred one day after the United States relaunched a contentious migrant enforcement program known as Remain in Mexico, which would force asylum seekers to wait across the border while their cases are determined in U.S. courts. The program has been criticized by human rights groups because of the unsafe conditions migrants face in Mexico. “Under the Remain in Mexico program, the United States and Mexico have knowingly put thousands of asylum seekers’ lives in danger,” Ari Sawyer, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, said in a statement Thursday.

Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Carl Hulse WASHINGTON — When 14 Senate Republicans joined forces with Democrats on Thursday to pave the way for Congress to avert a first-ever federal default, it reflected the crucial role of the pragmatic wing of the G.O.P. in a divided government. But it also showed how narrow that wing has become, and how willing the majority of Republicans were to use potential fiscal catastrophe as an opening to pummel President Biden and his party. In the not-too-distant past, the debt limit escape plan concocted by Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, and Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat and majority leader, would have been applauded by Republicans grateful for Mr. McConnell’s dexterity in getting them off the political hook on a tough issue. But in today’s Republican Party, it prompted considerable blowback from Mr. McConnell’s usually unquestioning colleagues. That is a mark of how far the party has strayed from what it once was, and reflects a growing divide in the Republican ranks, one likely to deepen next year if Republicans win control of the House and Senate through the election of new members who emerge from primaries that reward the furthest-right — and most uncompromising — candidates. Under the agreement struck between the two leaders, Congress approved an entirely new law — good for one-time use only — to set a simple Senate majority threshold for an increase in federal borrowing authority, clearing the way for Democrats to raise the debt ceiling on their own next week without threat of a Republican filibuster. The legislation advanced Thursday on a 64-to-36 vote, with Mr. McConnell and 13 other Republicans joining all 50 Democrats in support of taking it up while 36 Republicans objected. The measure was then approved and sent to Mr. Biden.   It was a classic McConnell gambit to find a way to allow the debt ceiling to be raised while simultaneously allowing all Republicans to vote against it. But most Republicans in the Senate and virtually all of them in the House, fearing primaries from the right and harsh condemnation from Mar-a-Lago, wanted nothing to do with the legislative sleight of hand. They denounced any move to allow the debt ceiling to be raised as complicity with Democrats’ multitrillion-dollar economic agenda — even though the increase is needed mainly to cover spending on existing programs, some of which Republicans supported. Republicans howled that Mr. McConnell should have stuck to his guns and forced Democrats to act entirely on their own, claiming that he had established a dangerous precedent by giving the House a role in circumventing Senate filibuster rules. “What we’ve done here is allowed the House to change the Senate rules in a fashion where if you can get 10 Republicans, all of us are dealt out,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. “That is not a good idea one time, 10 times or a hundred times — by either party.” Other Republicans said Mr. McConnell had put his own members in a political bind by combining the debt limit proposal with a measure to restore Medicare cuts — included as a sweetener to generate support, forcing anyone voting against the debt ceiling bill to also go on record as favoring cuts to Medicare, potentially upsetting older voters. “The disagreement that reasonable people are having over the debt limit has been conflated in a cynical attempt to fool the American people,” said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, who said members of his party had been given a “choice between voting for a heart attack or cancer.” But with the debt limit so inflammatory among hard-right conservatives as a proxy for Democratic spending plans, most Republicans chose to reject the legislation and risk being attacked on Medicare spending, figuring they could explain their way out. The dispute highlighted how profoundly today’s Republican Party is motivated by concern about being seen as accommodating Mr. Biden or congressional Democrats, suggesting difficulties ahead should the party take control of the Senate and it falls to them to increase the debt limit and perform the other basics of governing. Complicating matters is the fact that some of the seasoned Republicans who helped Mr. McConnell in this case — Senators Roy Blunt of Missouri, Rob Portman of Ohio and Richard Burr of North Carolina — are leaving Congress at the end of next year, shrinking the ranks of those willing to risk political blowback in the interest of keeping the government from falling into chaos. If Mr. McConnell is struggling to corral the current members of his Republican conference after 2020 elections that added more hard-right Republicans, it is likely only going to become more difficult when some of his most dependable allies are gone, potentially replaced by archconservatives fueled by antipathy to government and fealty to Donald J. Trump. The ongoing transformation of the Republican Party was underscored even further on Thursday by the fact that lawmakers were conducting memorial services in the Capitol Rotunda for Bob Dole, the former Senate Republican leader, presidential nominee and deal maker if there ever was one. Despite the bad optics of the Republican disagreement, Mr. McConnell’s supporters — and even some of those unhappy with his strategy — said he had made the smart move in finding a way to give Republicans an off-ramp.  What is the debt ceiling? The debt ceiling, also called the debt limit, is a cap on the total amount of money that the federal government is authorized to borrow via U.S. Treasury bills and savings bonds to fulfill its financial obligations. Because the U.S. runs budget deficits, it must borrow huge sums of money to pay its bills. When will the debt limit be breached? After Senate leaders agreed to a short-term deal to raise the debt ceiling on Oct. 7, Treasury estimated that the government would become unable to pay its bills soon after Dec. 15, when a $118 billion payment to the Highway Trust Fund is due. Why does the U.S. limit its borrowing? According to the Constitution, Congress must authorize borrowing. The debt limit was instituted in the early 20th century so the Treasury did not need to ask for permission each time it needed to issue bonds to pay bills. What would happen if the debt limit was hit? Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Congress that inaction on raising the debt limit could lead to a self-inflicted economic recession and a financial crisis. She also said that failing to raise the debt ceiling could affect programs that help millions of Americans, including delays to Social Security payments. Do other countries do it this way? Denmark also has a debt limit, but it is set so high that raising it is generally not an issue. Most other countries do not. In Poland, public debt cannot exceed 60 percent of gross domestic product. What are the alternatives to the debt ceiling? The lack of a replacement is one of the main reasons the debt ceiling has persisted. Ms. Yellen said that she would support legislation to abolish the debt limit, which she described as “destructive.” It would take an act of Congress to do away with the debt limit. “He is looking at the big picture, and he is looking at what is best for the country in terms of how we get past a crisis,” said Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota, who opposed the debt limit bill. The Republican leader’s chief miscalculation, several said, was declaring in October that neither he nor any other Republican would help raise the debt ceiling again after allowing a temporary increase to move forward — a stance from which he was forced to back down. But allies said he had little choice. Given the current struggles of the Biden administration, Republicans see themselves in a strong position to win back control of Congress next year, and Mr. McConnell and his top lieutenants were reluctant to give Democrats any ammunition to turn the tide.  They saw failure to raise the debt ceiling and the ensuing economic fallout as a potential political liability that Republicans had to avoid, even if they were uncomfortable doing so. “It makes no sense to change the subject,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas and one of those who voted to advance the legislation. “When your adversary is imploding, why interrupt him?” Republicans also noted that the agreement preserved the Senate filibuster, a chief objective of Mr. McConnell. He feared that continuing the Republican blockade against raising the debt limit would force the hand of the few remaining Democratic holdouts against weakening the filibuster, an outcome he wanted to avoid at all costs. While the legislation created a one-time exception from the requirement to secure 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, it did so only with Republican consent and cooperation. Lastly, the agreement will require Democrats to set a specific amount for the increase rather than something more amorphous, providing what Mr. McConnell and other Republicans saw as a good cudgel for the midterm elections as they hammer Democrats on spending and inflation. In the end, Mr. McConnell hopes that the machinations and infighting will be forgotten, and that voters will remember only that Democrats increased the federal debt ceiling themselves by hundreds of millions — possibly trillions — of dollars, sparking a backlash that restores Republicans to power.  Then Mr. McConnell will have to figure out how to govern with colleagues who seem increasingly uninterested in doing so. Advertisement"

Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Emily Cochrane WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday cleared away the last major hurdle to raising the debt ceiling, approving legislation that would all but guarantee that Congress will be able to move quickly in the coming days to steer the government away from a first-ever federal default. The breakthrough came after 14 Republicans joined every Democrat to effectively end their party’s monthslong blockade of debt-limit legislation, allowing the bill to advance in the 50-50 Senate. The legislation later passed by a similar margin, 59 to 35, with 10 Republicans joining Democrats for final passage. President Biden is expected to quickly sign the bill into law. It would establish a one-time fast-track process for Congress to increase the statutory borrowing limit by a set amount that is still to be determined. That would pave the way for a separate vote to raise the limit by as much as $2.5 trillion, expected early next week. It puts Congress on track to avoid a fiscal crisis with little time to spare. The Treasury Department has said that it could breach the statutory debt limit soon after Dec. 15, and would no longer be able to finance the government’s obligations. Thursday’s vote broke through months of politically charged wrangling in the Senate, where Republicans had refused for months to let Democrats take up any long-term debt ceiling increase, using the filibuster to block their efforts to do so. The stalemate ended this week, when Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and minority leader, cut a deal with leading Democrats on a convoluted process that would allow the borrowing cap to be raised on a simple majority vote. That way the measure could pass with only Democrats supporting it, rather than subjecting it to the 60-vote threshold that applies to most major legislation. Mr. McConnell was among the 10 Republicans who voted both to advance and pass the legislation, amid recriminations from lawmakers and activists in his party who said it was a betrayal. The measure was packaged with legislation that would postpone scheduled cuts to Medicare, farm aid and other mandatory spending programs, a sweetener for reluctant Republicans who have held firm against giving Democrats the ability to raise the debt ceiling. “No brinksmanship, no default on the debt, no risk of another recession — responsible governing won the day,” said Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat who is the majority leader, after the vote. Earlier in the day, he thanked Mr. McConnell for the “fruitful, candid, productive” discussions that led to the agreement. For Democrats, it was a crucial step toward completing a slew of must-pass bills this month, coming after Republicans and Democrats clinched an agreement on the annual defense policy legislation earlier this week, and on the heels of enacting a stopgap spending measure to fund the government until mid-February. Democrats were eager to focus their full attention on muscling through Mr. Biden’s marquee domestic policy legislation before Christmas, though the prospects for doing so were murky. While Democrats have not said how much they will increase the borrowing cap, it is expected that they will try to delay another fiscal standoff until after the midterm elections next year. One Treasury estimate suggested they would need to raise it by as much as $2.5 trillion to cover that period, according to a person familiar with the preliminary accounting who disclosed it on the condition of anonymity. The legislative contortions were necessary because of Republicans’ intransigence on the debt limit. Given that Democrats are using the fast-track budget reconciliation process to muscle through Mr. Biden’s $2.2 trillion climate, tax and social spending bill over their opposition, Republicans had demanded that Democrats use the same maneuver to address the debt limit. Democrats objected, arguing that both parties were responsible for raising the borrowing cap to accommodate spending that had been approved by and incurred under both Republican and Democratic administrations. Reconciliation, they added, would be an unnecessarily complex and time-consuming way to do so. In October, Mr. McConnell relented temporarily, corralling 10 of his colleagues to join him in breaking his own party’s filibuster of a short-term increase to the debt limit, which then passed with only Democratic votes. But he warned in a scathing letter to Mr. Biden that he would not do so again. Two Republicans who supported the measure in October, Senators Richard C. Shelby of Alabama and Mike Rounds of South Dakota, withheld their votes on Thursday. “They could do this through reconciliation without any Republican support,” Mr. Rounds told reporters ahead of the vote. “We bailed them out by calling the question last time to give them an opportunity to do so, and yet they seem to have simply sat back and expected that we would once again provide special opportunities for them.” Mr. McConnell and Mr. Schumer began quietly discussing alternatives in November, including the possibility of attaching a debt-limit increase to the annual defense policy bill, the last must-pass piece of legislation trudging through Congress before the end of the year. Congressional leaders announced the deal on Tuesday and the House then passed the measure with all but one Republican voting in opposition. What is the debt ceiling? The debt ceiling, also called the debt limit, is a cap on the total amount of money that the federal government is authorized to borrow via U.S. Treasury bills and savings bonds to fulfill its financial obligations. Because the U.S. runs budget deficits, it must borrow huge sums of money to pay its bills. When will the debt limit be breached? After Senate leaders agreed to a short-term deal to raise the debt ceiling on Oct. 7, Treasury estimated that the government would become unable to pay its bills soon after Dec. 15, when a $118 billion payment to the Highway Trust Fund is due. Why does the U.S. limit its borrowing? According to the Constitution, Congress must authorize borrowing. The debt limit was instituted in the early 20th century so the Treasury did not need to ask for permission each time it needed to issue bonds to pay bills. What would happen if the debt limit was hit? Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Congress that inaction on raising the debt limit could lead to a self-inflicted economic recession and a financial crisis. She also said that failing to raise the debt ceiling could affect programs that help millions of Americans, including delays to Social Security payments. Do other countries do it this way? Denmark also has a debt limit, but it is set so high that raising it is generally not an issue. Most other countries do not. In Poland, public debt cannot exceed 60 percent of gross domestic product. What are the alternatives to the debt ceiling? The lack of a replacement is one of the main reasons the debt ceiling has persisted. Ms. Yellen said that she would support legislation to abolish the debt limit, which she described as “destructive.” It would take an act of Congress to do away with the debt limit. Several Republicans seethed over the agreement, accusing Mr. McConnell and his allies of caving and warning that the maneuver would set up a dangerous precedent that could erode the rules of the Senate filibuster that have long protected the minority party. “It sure as hell sets in motion playing with the rules of the Senate in a fashion that I never even thought of until 24 hours ago,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. “I want to make this hard, not easy, because I think what we’re doing is going to really change the structure of the Senate and certainly going to do a lot of damage to the Republican Party.” But as he did in October, Mr. McConnell was able to scrounge together support from a coalition that included members of his leadership team, centrists and retiring lawmakers. Republicans said that as long as Democrats took responsibility for the final vote raising the limit, they would be satisfied, promising to use the vote as a political cudgel in the midterm elections. The Republicans who broke with their party on Thursday included some of the same ones who had supported Mr. McConnell’s move in October: Senators John Thune of South Dakota, John Barrasso of Wyoming, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, and Roy Blunt of Missouri. “We don’t need to be sending signals anywhere in the world that we’re not going to back the full faith and credit in the United States,” Ms. Murkowski told reporters after the vote. Some Republicans who had opposed taking up the short-term debt limit increase ended up voting for the measure, including Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Mitt Romney of Utah. A few Republicans were swayed by the decision to package the debt limit process with the postponement of mandatory cuts to a range of federal spending programs, including community block grants, farm aid and a 4 percent reduction in Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals. The legislation would also extend a temporary pay increase in Medicare implemented earlier in the pandemic, allowing doctors and hospitals to keep their current pay rates until April, when the cut begins to phase out. Two Republicans, Joni Ernst of Iowa and Roger Wicker of Mississippi, voted to advance the measure, but opposed final passage. Another two Republicans, Richard M. Burr of North Carolina and John Cornyn of Texas, were absent for the final vote, but joined their colleagues in voting to take up the measure. Advertisement"

Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Jonathan Weisman WASHINGTON — ADW Capital Partners would appear to be the kind of hedge fund that Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee would like to tax more heavily: small but growing fast, with $330 million in assets, an address in New York, an incorporation in Delaware but doing business in Florida, and an offshore “feeder” corporation shielding some of its clients from U.S. taxation. No wonder, then, that its owner, Adam Wyden, has come out as a vocal and vociferous critic of the tax increases being pushed by the committee’s chairman, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon — his father. The public dispute between son and father over the elder Mr. Wyden’s dogged efforts to tax the wealth of the superrich and close loopholes that have particularly benefited the richest financiers has accentuated a particular phenomenon that has helped to shield America’s billionaires. Each time Congress weighs taxing them, the merely rich rush to run interference for the fabulously rich. Adam Wyden, 37, made it clear he does not want to push his familial dispute too far. “The issue is bigger than my father. I’m not interested in discussing anything personal,” he said in a brief phone call before declining to go further. He said he was “not a Trumper” and “not an Ocasio” — referring to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, an icon of the Democratic left. He is a libertarian, he said, raised in Washington, D.C., who moved to Florida “to get away from the food fight.” But he has gone public with his grievances against his father’s proposals, in an appearance last month on CNBC that he recommended for viewing, and in a tweet responding to the elder Mr. Wyden’s assertion that Elon Musk and other billionaires should not get to decide whether to pay taxes based on a Twitter poll. “Why does he hate us / the American dream so much?!?!?!?!” Adam Wyden said in the Twitter post last month. “Reality is: most legislators have never built anything … so I guess it’s easier to mindlessly and haphazardly try and tear stuff down.” His father would like to avoid the subject all together. “He doesn’t talk to me about his business, and I don’t talk to him about mine,” Senator Wyden, 72, said in an interview on Wednesday. But as President Biden’s $2.2 trillion social safety net and climate change bill has languished in the Senate, Mr. Wyden has kept alive the proposals his son has spoken out against. One would tax the annual wealth gains of about 700 American billionaires, some of whom were shown in a series of ProPublica reports to have paid a tiny fraction of their wealth in taxes, while some paid no income taxes at all. The proposal would raise $557 billion over 10 years and turn the Build Back Better Act into a bona fide deficit reducer. Another would change the rules that business partnerships have used to avoid taxation and evade Internal Revenue Service audits. Still another would close the so-called carried-interest loophole, which allows some hedge fund and private equity managers to claim the fees they charge clients as capital gains, not income — and pay much lower tax rates. Monte A. Jackel, an expert on the taxation of partnerships and a counsel at the tax practice Leo Berwick, said Adam Wyden would undoubtedly pay higher taxes under some of his father’s proposals. The senator’s efforts to close the carried-interest loophole would mean income on which his son now pays a 20 percent tax rate would instead be taxed annually as high as 37 percent. Efforts to shut down offshore partnerships could hurt the younger Mr. Wyden indirectly, by costing him some clients, Mr. Jackel said. He pointed to the structure of Mr. Wyden’s fund, which includes a “master fund” partnership in the United States and an “offshore feeder” foreign corporation, which allows tax-exempt and foreign investors to avoid U.S. taxation. But Adam Wyden is hardly one of the big whales that most Senate Democrats are eyeing to pay for their spending. With three employees, a little more than 150 investors and $329 million in assets under management, ADW Capital Partners is successful but no titan. Citadel Advisors, a large hedge fund, has $235 billion in assets and more than 2,000 employees. “At a maximum,” Adam Wyden might have $12 million in adjusted gross income, said Steven N. Kaplan, a finance professor at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business. He would in no way be hit by his father’s wealth tax, which would be levied only on people with $1 billion in assets or $100 million or more in income over three consecutive years. He might be affected by a provision in the House-passed version of the social policy bill, which would impose a 5 percent surtax on income over $10 million. But his father has said he would much rather hit billionaires than millionaires, and has complained that the House plan taxes N.B.A. players while letting team owners off the hook. Yet Adam Wyden burst into view by defending one of his father’s real targets, Mr. Musk, after the Tesla founder asked Twitter followers whether he should sell shares of the company and pay taxes on them, and then insulted Senator Wyden with what appeared to be a vulgar slight. “Thankfully, I think I can compound” investment gains “faster than my dad and his cronies can confiscate it,” Adam Wyden wrote. Lauded on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” he elaborated on air. “Amazon, Netflix, Google, Tesla: I mean, we are the envy of the rest of the world,” he said. “People come to this country to build amazing businesses, and I want that to continue.” Without referring to his son, the elder Mr. Wyden suggested a possible reason for his stance: “Many millionaires perhaps may consider themselves tomorrow’s billionaires.” Dennis Kelleher, who heads Better Markets, a group that works against income inequality, said the marshaling of little guys to protect the big guys “happens all the time.” Small-business owners protest estate taxes they will never pay. Community banks protest regulations aimed at the large banks that are their biggest competitors. Minimum-wage workers are somehow framed as the targets for I.R.S. enforcement proposals aimed at the ultrarich. “Not only does it distort discussion of incredibly important policy,” he said, “it ends up advancing the interest of this very small number of people and industries that have a chokehold on public policy in Washington.” Adam Wyden is a reluctant rebel. He said he had “no interest in engaging in a Wyden-versus-Wyden” story, and was more interested in talking about his Jewish grandfather cheating on his medical exam to win the chance to invade Normandy on D-Day and become a decorated war hero. He is hardly the only wealthy person sticking up for the fantastically rich. The billionaire class has long leaned on farmers and ranchers to beat back efforts to tax inheritances more heavily. This year, the tactic worked to kill a proposal from Mr. Biden that would have set the value of inherited assets at their original purchase price, not their worth at the time of the original owner’s death. That “step up” in the value of an inherited asset means that its unrealized gains over a lifetime are often never taxed, a boon to wealthy heirs, protected in Washington by those considered politically untouchable. That includes family farmers, who are actually unlikely to be affected given the Democratic proposals include protections for farms, ranches and small businesses. Two former Democratic senators from rural states, Max Baucus of Montana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, lobbied against the Biden proposal and quickly won over Senator Jon Tester, the current Democrat from Montana, who killed it in October in the name of “our family farms, ranches and small businesses.” Senator Wyden insists he is not giving up. “Next year when people are sorting this out, after hearing over and over that billionaires are paying little or nothing,” he said, they need to see that has changed. He added, “We’re going to be staying at it.” Advertisement"

The jury deliberated for more than nine hours. Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Julia Jacobs and Mark Guarino A jury in Chicago found the actor Jussie Smollett guilty on Thursday of falsely reporting to the police that he had been the victim of a racist and homophobic assault in 2019, an attack that investigators concluded was a hoax directed by the actor himself. With its finding, after more than nine hours of deliberation, the 12-person jury indicated it had chosen to believe the accounts of two brothers who testified that Mr. Smollett had asked them to mildly injure him as part of a publicity stunt. Mr. Smollett, wearing a dark gray suit and a blue shirt, sat upright in his chair, hands clasped, staring directly at the jury just after the verdict was read. Daniel K. Webb, the special prosecutor who handled the case, said afterward that Mr. Smollett only made matters worse by continuing to stand by his account at trial. “This jury worked so hard,” Mr. Webb said, “and for Mr. Smollett to come up before them and lie for hours and hours and hours — that really compounded his misconduct.” transcript Now that they’ve decided that Smollett should have been convicted, I believe that we in the special prosecutor’s office made the right decision to reindict him. We made the right decision to take a trial, and we got a verdict that is obviously a resounding success for us. For him to fake a hate crime, fake it and then cause the Police Department to spend enormous efforts taking them off of homicide cases and putting them on this case, I thought that was bad conduct. I mean, it was not insignificant. I thought it was serious criminal misconduct that needed to be approached and have a public trial about it. We’re obviously very disappointed. We obviously respectfully disagree with the jury’s verdict. The verdict is inconsistent. You cannot say Jussie’s lying and Jussie is not lying for the same exact incident. So we feel 100 percent confidence that this case will be won on appeal. The case dated back to the frigid early hours of Jan. 29, 2019, when Mr. Smollett — known then for his role in the Fox music-industry drama “Empire” — told the police he had been the victim of a hate crime near his apartment building in Chicago. Mr. Smollett said one of his attackers had even yelled, “This is MAGA country.” His account captured the attention of a politically polarized nation concerned with rising hate crime reports and the persistent threat of racism. But public support for Mr. Smollett quickly evaporated when investigators came to the conclusion three weeks later that he had staged the attack on himself. Chicago officials, upset at the amount of police work that was spent on the case, have sued Mr. Smollett to recoup some of the city’s costs. They were similarly critical in 2019 when the office of the city’s top prosecutor, Kim Foxx, who early on had recused herself from the case, citing a potential conflict, quietly dropped the charges in exchange for Mr. Smollett’s agreement to forfeit his $10,000 bond and perform community service. The case was later revived by Mr. Webb, who reviewed that decision and ultimately announced that a grand jury had charged Mr. Smollett with six counts of felony disorderly conduct. Mr. Smollett was convicted on five counts on Thursday, relating to conversations he had with the police just after the attack. He was acquitted on the sixth count, which related to a follow-up conversation with an investigator two weeks later. The actor faces up to three years in prison. The judge did not set a sentencing date and released him on bond. His defense team said Mr. Smollett would appeal. “We remain confident that we’re going to come back and he’s going to be vindicated,” said Nenye Uche, one of the actor’s lawyers. Prosecutors argued in court that Mr. Smollett had instructed two brothers, Abimbola Osundairo and Olabinjo Osundairo, on all of the details of the attack, specifying that they should punch him only hard enough to create a bruise, pour bleach on his clothing and place a rope around his neck like a noose. The prosecutors faulted Mr. Smollett for not cooperating adequately with the investigation by balking at turning over evidence like his cellphone. “Mr. Smollett didn’t want the crime solved,” Mr. Webb said during his closing argument on Wednesday. “He wanted to report it as a hate crime; he wanted media exposure; but he didn’t want the brothers apprehended.” Mr. Webb told the jury that Mr. Smollett staged the attack because he had received a death threat in the mail and was upset by the muted response of the producers behind “Empire,” the television show on which he starred. The defense came forward with a sharply different account of Mr. Smollett’s attitudes and behaviors. The actor had not been upset by the TV studio’s response to the letter, his lawyers said, and had, in fact, turned down its offer to have security drive Mr. Smollett to and from the set. They said the Osundairo brothers were liars who had attacked Mr. Smollett to scare him into hiring them as bodyguards, and who concocted a story to avoid prosecution themselves. Mr. Smollett’s lawyer Mr. Uche argued that prosecutors had not established that the actor had a clear motive for any scheme, and that, in fact, his client had every reason not to have faked an attack. “His lack of motive is pretty obvious: Media attention, he doesn’t like it,” Mr. Uche said. What is more, he said, Mr. Smollett had a music video shoot coming up and could not afford his face getting bruised. Mr. Smollett, 39, took the stand and testified for more than seven hours in an effort to counter the narrative of the brothers, who had detailed how Mr. Smollett planned the attack. He said his interactions with the brothers in the days and hours leading up to the attack had been harmless. A “dry run” in his car that the brothers had described to the jury as a planning exercise two days before the attack was really an aimless drive through Chicago smoking marijuana. But the jury chose to believe the brothers. Abimbola Osundairo, 28, a fitness aficionado who had appeared on “Empire” in minor roles, testified that the planning began when Mr. Smollett, whom he was helping train for the music video, texted him for help with something “on the low.” “He said he wanted me to beat him up,” Mr. Osundairo said of their meeting. “I looked puzzled, and then he explained he wanted me to fake beat him up.” Mr. Osundairo said he agreed to the plan because he felt “indebted” to Mr. Smollett for getting him a role as a stand-in on “Empire.” Olabinjo Osundairo, 30, who had also appeared on “Empire” in minor roles, said he participated to “curry favor” with Mr. Smollett. A staged hate crime? In 2019, Jussie Smollett, an actor from the show “Empire,” told police he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in downtown Chicago. The police concluded that Mr. Smollett had paid two acquaintances to stage the assault. Others involved. Two brothers, Abimbola Osundairo and Olabinjo Osundairo, told the police that Smollett, who is black and gay, had paid them $3,500 to orchestrate the attack, directing them to shout racist and homophobic epithets at him and place a noose over his neck. The evidence. A text message between Smollett and Abimsola Osundairo sent  four days before the attack has become a key piece of evidence. In it, Smollett discussed needing help and meeting “on the low.” Security camera footage shows Mr. Smollett’s black Mercedes pulling up in an alley behind one of the brothers’ homes that afternoon. Charges dropped. A month after the attack, the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office dropped all charges against Mr. Smollett. The office had agreed to a plan where Mr. Smollett would do community service and forfeit the $10,000 bond paid for his release, in exchange for the office dropping the charges, with no admission of guilt. The case is revived. Later, a judge ordered that a special prosecutor review how the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office handled the case. On Feb. 11, 2020, the special prosecutor, Dan K. Webb, announced that a grand jury had revived the case with a new indictment, and he criticized the earlier decision to drop the case. The Osundairos testified that Mr. Smollett staged the attack at an intersection near his apartment where he hoped the encounter would be captured on a nearby surveillance camera. The camera ended up being pointed in a different direction. But the prosecution had other surveillance footage of Mr. Smollett’s car circling the area where the attack occurred on the day of the reported dry run. The prosecutors also showed the jury messages that Mr. Smollett sent to Abimbola Osundairo in the hours before the attack, updating him on his delayed flight to Chicago. Investigators said he was alerting the brothers that the time for their planned hoax would have to be moved back. At one point, prosecutors showed jurors a $3,500 check from Mr. Smollett to the brothers, which Abimbola Osundairo said he believed was, at least in part, payment for carrying out the attack. Mr. Smollett said the payment was only for a diet and exercise plan. He denied he had been texting the brothers information to delay any planned attack, and said that many followers on social media responded to his posts about the flight delay. And he said he had set up the meeting “on the low” with Abimbola Osundairo to arrange help in getting herbal weight-loss steroids from Nigeria that are not legal in the United States. Mr. Smollett denied having attempted to thwart the investigation, asserting that he had not turned over his cellphone because he did not trust the Chicago police to keep its contents private. Similarly, he said, he did not think to call the police in the first place to report the attack — his creative director did. “I am a Black man in America,” Mr. Smollett said. “I do not trust police. Sorry, that is the truth.” Though composed and confident during his first day of cross-examination on Monday, Mr. Smollett seemed flustered during heated exchanges with Mr. Webb on Tuesday. The prosecutor made a point of challenging Mr. Smollett’s initial identification of his attackers, who wore ski masks, as white. The Osundairo brothers were Black, Mr. Webb pointed out, and he questioned how Mr. Smollett could not have recognized the voice or build of Abimbola Osundairo, whom the actor had said he spent a good bit of time with socially. Mr. Smollett said that during the moment he was being assaulted he did not think to say, “Bola, is that you?” “Sir,” Mr. Webb said later on, “do you think by claiming this person was white it would bring more credibility for a fake hate crime?” “You’d have to ask someone who did a fake crime,” Mr. Smollett replied. The defense also worked to undercut the credibility of the brothers, seeking to portray Olabinjo Osundairo as homophobic and someone who may have felt antagonistic toward Mr. Smollett, who is gay. Mr. Osundairo denied any bias and said that he had “no hate for anybody.” The prosecution’s case, in the end, relied heavily on the confidence it had that the testimony of the Osundairo brothers, bolstered by surveillance tapes and text messages, would be convincing. After the verdict, their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt Rodriguez, said: “Even though they’re satisfied with the results and they had expectations this would be the results, there is still a part of them that is hurting. They regretted their role in this.” Advertisement"
18,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/10/business/elon-musk-philanthropy.html,Elon Musk’s Latest Innovation: Troll Philanthropy - The New York Times,12/10/2021,"Some very wealthy people give their money away in an attempt to burnish their reputations. Not the Tesla C.E.O. Credit...Alvaro Dominguez Supported by By Nicholas Kulish The richest people on earth typically devote a share of their vast resources to charity. That is the bargain and the expectation, anyway. Jeff Bezos, until very recently the world’s richest human, has been applying himself dutifully if a bit cautiously to the task, giving money to food banks and homeless families while pledging $10 billion of the fortune he earned through the online retailer Amazon to fight climate change. The latest richest human, Elon Musk, has taken a rather different tack. There was the public spat with the director of the World Food Programme on Twitter, for instance, announcing, “If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it.” There was the online poll asking whether he should sell 10 percent of his Tesla shares in order to pay taxes on at least part of his wealth, like most people do without running a survey first. And, of course, there is the ongoing insistence that his moneymaking efforts, running both the electric carmaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX are already bettering humankind, thank you very much. Mr. Musk is practicing “troll philanthropy.” That’s what Benjamin Soskis, senior research associate in the Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy at the Urban Institute, has called it, noting that Mr. Musk seems to be having fun with this novel approach. “He doesn’t seem to care much about using his philanthropy to curry public favor,” Mr. Soskis said. “In fact, he seems to enjoy using his identity as a philanthropist in part to antagonize the public.” Before this year, one estimate put his giving at $100 million, a lot by almost any standard, except for multibillionaires like Mr. Musk. Most wealthy people do the opposite. They use philanthropy to burnish their image or distract the public from the business practices that earned them their enormous wealth in the first place. When, how and why the ultrarich choose to give their fortunes away matters more than ever because so much money is concentrated in their hands and so little of it is taxable under current rules. Society is to some extent presently stuck relying on voluntary disbursements from those with the greatest means. “The idea that philanthropy, that any single individual, has enough money to affect something at a global scale is a very new phenomenon,” said Homi Kharas, a senior fellow at the Center for Sustainable Development at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Most billionaires have “accumulated their wealth because the world economy is now globalized, but to sustain a globalized world economy we need to have more inclusive growth.” There are many different kinds of givers, like Mr. Bezos’s ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, who has focused her billions on diversity and equity. There are the self-declared “effective altruists,” like the Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and his wife, Cari Tuna, part of a movement searching for evidence-based approaches to find causes where their money does the most good. And there are the traditionalists, like Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg, who have built institutions to handle their funding. Mr. Musk and Mr. Bezos are, with $268 billion and $202 billion respectively, the two richest Americans for the time being, drawing sharper contrasts between their approaches to giving back. Earlier this year, Mr. Bezos took the stage with United Nations Deputy Secretary General Amina J. Mohammed and listened as former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry sang his praises, saying, “He is stepping up in a way that an awful lot of people who have the wherewithal do not step up.” Mr. Musk, meanwhile, replied to a tweet by Senator Bernie Sanders demanding “that the extremely wealthy pay their share,” by replying, “I keep forgetting that you’re still alive.” Mr. Musk’s nontraditional approach to giving doesn’t stop people who need his donations, like David Beasley, executive director of the World Food Programme, from seeking his help. “The resources at his disposal are so vast and potentially consequential that we have to engage him, and accept some of that trolling, if we want to try to exert some pressure on him and shape his somewhat inchoate philanthropic priorities,” Mr. Soskis said. Mr. Musk did not respond to an email asking him to discuss his philanthropic giving. The notion that rich people have a moral obligation to give is an ancient one. Mr. Soskis, a historian of philanthropy, notes that wealthy citizens in ancient Rome tried to outdo one another paying for public baths and theaters. The inscriptions on those edifices could count as a form of early donor lists. The idea that the richest might need charity to improve their public relations is also longstanding, driven home in the Gilded Age by the 1882 outburst by railway magnate William Henry Vanderbilt, “The public be damned!” that shadowed him to the end of his days. Efforts to track the charitable giving of the very wealthy in the United States date to the late 19th century, when the ranks of millionaires exploded. Before long, newspapers were running front-page lists of who had made the biggest gifts. The original duo to capture public attention were John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, whose feelings on publicizing philanthropy were diametrically opposed. Cartoons from the era showed Mr. Carnegie, often dressed in a kilt to reference his Scottish origin, showering coins from enormous bags of money. “The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced,” Mr. Carnegie wrote in “The Gospel of Wealth,” his treatise on giving. Mr. Rockefeller preferred to keep his giving more private and had to be convinced to announce his gifts. To those who think the trolling started on Twitter, philanthropy was never quite as polite as we imagine today. George Eastman, one of the founders of Eastman-Kodak, called those who did not give their money away during their lifetimes “pie-faced mutts.” Julius Rosenwald, the chairman of Sears, Roebuck and Company and a major philanthropist in his day, insisted that the accumulation of wealth had nothing to do with smarts, adding, “Some very rich men who made their own fortunes have been among the stupidest men I have ever met in my life.” But the idea that giving helps the reputation is at best only partially true. Givers are celebrated at times but just as often the higher profile means their motives and choices are picked apart. The Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and the Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are each worth over $120 billion, per Forbes, but none of them receives the level of scrutiny that Mr. Gates does, for instance. “If you put your head above the philanthropic parapet and say, ‘I’m interested in the environment,’ or whatever cause area, people can start to question it,” said Beth Breeze, author of the recent book “In Defence of Philanthropy.” Ms. Breeze has pushed back against the recent trend of criticizing philanthropists, who, she says, are regularly described as “tax dodging, egotistical, irritating” — criticism they may earn, but not comments that she views as useful to the greater good. “My concern is not for the thin skins of the rich people. They can take care of themselves. My concern is if the money dries up,” said Ms. Breeze, who was a fund-raiser for a youth homeless center before becoming an academic and identifies as a left-wing Labour Party supporter in Britain.  A troll philanthropist might be an easy target for criticism. But donating money in all the usual ways is no break from critical rebukes. There are several different schools of criticism deployed for different kinds of givers. There is the structural argument that philanthropy serves as another means of using wealth to cement power and influence. Large grants are often compared with the giver’s total net worth to show that as a percentage of their wealth the gifts are much smaller than they appear in absolute terms. Gifts to cultural institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Ivy League schools are now regularly assailed for reinforcing the status quo. Even gifts to rebuild the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris after it caught fire earned significant blowback. Technocratic institutions that set exacting benchmarks for gifts and place strict limits on how their money can be spent are tagged as controlling and hierarchical. In contrast, general operating support without guidance on how the money can be used has been applauded by many lately as the best approach. Mr. Bezos was named by the Chronicle of Philanthropy this past February to the top spot on its 2020 “Philanthropy 50” list, even though most of that was for his $10 billion pledge to his own Bezos Earth Fund, which had barely gotten up and running. It was a bit like Barack Obama’s surprise Nobel Peace Prize less than a year into his presidency in the way that it seemed to sharpen critiques rather than dull them. But after a slow start to his giving, Mr. Bezos has begun to look like the good pupil. He gave $100 million to the Feeding America food bank network and another $100 million to Mr. Obama’s presidential center. The money has been flowing more quickly out of the Bezos Earth Fund as well. Just this past week he announced another 44 grants worth a total of $443 million to groups working on issues including climate justice and conservation, part of that $10 billion pledge. “You need to have a pretty sharp pencil of analysis in order to allocate funds well,” said Andrew Steer, president of the Bezos Earth Fund, in an interview. Mr. Musk himself started out with what seemed like a somewhat conventional approach to giving. He created the Musk Foundation in 2002 and signed the nonbinding Giving Pledge to give away half his wealth in 2012. (The Musk Foundation website could, itself, be considered a bit of a troll, with its 33 words in black text on a white background.) For the fiscal year ending June 2020, the Musk Foundation made donations of a little less than $3 million to nine groups, mostly related to education, and gave $20 million to Fidelity Charitable, which operates the kind of donor-advised funds that critics say can function as a parking lot for charitable dollars. That was out of nearly $1 billion available in the Musk Foundation coffers by the end of the fiscal year. Since then he has announced $150 million in gifts, including a $100 million innovation prize for carbon removal and $30 million to nonprofits in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas. Those may have been at least as much about a legal requirement as a newfound sense of munificence. Tax laws require private foundations to pay out roughly 5 percent of their endowments annually. “The particular barrier for donors from a tech background is they don’t just think their genius has made them good at what they do, they also think what they do commercially also makes society better,” said Rhodri Davies, a philanthropy commentator who wrote a piece on Mr. Musk called “The Edgelord Giveth.” Mr. Musk, for instance, has said that getting humankind to Mars through SpaceX is an important contribution and has written and spoken acerbically about what he calls “anti-billionaire BS,” including attempts to target taxes at billionaires. “It does not make sense to take the job of capital allocation away from people who have demonstrated great skill in capital allocation and give it to an entity that has demonstrated very poor skill in capital allocation, which is the government,” Mr. Musk said on Monday at an event hosted by The Wall Street Journal. At the same time, Mr. Kharas said a more charitable reading of Mr. Musk’s exchange with the World Food Programme is possible. He could just genuinely want to know how the money will be spent and is putting in public, on Twitter, the due diligence work that institutional giving does behind closed doors. “I think this idea that he was willing to engage was really good,” Mr. Kharas of the Brookings Institution said of Mr. Musk. “I think his response was extremely sensible. It was basically, ‘Show me what you can do. Demonstrate it. Provide me with some evidence. I’ll do it.’” The W.F.P. published a breakdown of how they would spend the $6.6 billion, but there’s no word yet on whether Mr. Musk will make a donation. MacKenzie Scott’s latest letter about her giving included a lot of philosophical musings most billionaires do not routinely share. But she left out precisely the details everyone was waiting for — how many billion dollars went to which groups? Instead she said, stop paying so much attention to billionaires and think about what you can give. In a winking gesture to everyone waiting for the latest cash tally, she wrote the whole thing without using a single dollar sign. Classic troll move. Advertisement"

Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Karen Zraick The restoration of New York Harbor has reached a new milestone as 2021 draws to a close: 11.2 million juvenile oysters have been added in the past six months to a section of the Hudson River off the coast of Lower Manhattan, where they are helping to filter the water and creating habitats for other marine life. The bivalves will not be headed to a serving platter: The waters are still too polluted to eat from freely, after absorbing centuries’ worth of trash, sewage and industrial waste. But the water quality in the area is steadily improving, and oysters — which were once so prevalent in the waters that they served as a staple in New Yorkers’ diets — are playing a key role in the shift. The city was once one of the world’s great oyster capitals, exporting millions of them across the country and around the globe. They were sold from street stands, saloons and barges. New Yorkers of all social classes could enjoy them, whether raw, roasted, pickled, fried, or in chowders, sauces and stews. In his book “The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell,” the author Mark Kurlansky writes that the history of New York oysters is a history of the city itself. Years of over-harvesting and environmental degradation left the waters so fouled that oysters could not even survive there for a time. Now, in addition to the ones being introduced, wild ones are being found on the bottoms of piers off the West Side of Manhattan and in the Bronx. It may be another 100 years before anyone can safely eat an oyster from the waters, said Carrie Roble, vice president for estuary and education at the Hudson River Park Trust’s River Project, a marine biology monitoring station on Pier 40, near West Houston Street. But the oysters are a symbol of resilience, and a rare hopeful sign amid ominous news about New York waterways in the age of rapid climate change. If they grow big enough, the oyster reefs can even play a role in dissipating wave energy, helping to protect the city’s shorelines from storm surges and flooding in extreme weather. “They’re habitat-builders,” Ms. Roble said. The newly deployed oysters are attached to more than 200 subtidal habitats, including metal orbs, cages and mesh wraps, in the water between Piers 26 and 34, off TriBeCa. It’s the first large-scale habitat restoration within the Hudson River Park’s estuarine sanctuary, an area where fresh water from the river and saltwater from the Atlantic Ocean mix and create a nutrient-rich ecosystem for more than 85 species of fish. Ms. Roble noted that the estuary is a crucial incubator for regional waterways, and that many types of fish migrate through the area or spawn there. Striped bass caught in Connecticut or New Jersey likely spent time in the Hudson when they were young. And more vibrant marine life leads to exponential growth. For example, big populations of menhaden, a small silver fish, attract humpback whales that feed on them. The $1.5 million project was designed by the Hudson River Park Trust, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the engineering firm Moffatt and Nichol, using state funding. The “seeded” oysters came from the Billion Oyster Project, a nonprofit with a mission to make its name a reality in New York Harbor by 2035. The group says it has already restored 75 million oysters to the area since its founding in 2014. “Nobody’s really done this before,” Kevin Quinn, senior vice president of design and construction for Hudson River Park, said in an interview last month as workers prepared to lower more of the oyster homes into the water. “It’s exciting. I hope we get to do it again.” The installation of the underwater habitats began in July and was set to conclude on Friday. Together, they create a reef-like system that acts as a corridor for fish and a home for more oysters, mussels and barnacles. In addition to the millions of young oysters, which are known as spat, 600 adult oysters were also installed. They came from a program established during the pandemic to help oyster farmers who saw business drop because of restaurant closures. “Usually we’re building the piers,” said John O’Neill, a supervisor for Reicon Group, the contractor that installed the oyster apparatuses. “This is an experiment in environmental conservation.” Riverkeeper, a nonprofit that has fought to restore the Hudson since the 1960s, also helped to conceive of the project. “Oysters represent a keystone species in our estuaries with immense ecological value,” the group’s senior habitat restoration manager, George Jackman, said in a statement. “Along with reducing sewage overflows, adding oyster reefs and other bivalves is one of the best ways to restore the health and maintain the biodiversity of the Hudson River Estuary.” The researchers at the River Project will track the oysters and their effect on the water. They run a small, free aquarium at Pier 40 that is designed expressly to educate the public about the abundant marine life in the area. One very special oyster, named Big, lives under the pier. At 8.6 inches and 1.9 pounds, it was believed to be the biggest oyster found in New York Harbor in a century when it was discovered in 2018. Big has grown only slightly since then, but it is doing well, River Project staff members said after measuring and examining it during a recent tour. One challenge for the educators at the River Project is driving home to visitors who learn about the oysters that they are not safe to eat. The city still releases untreated sewage into the waterways during periods of heavy rain, introducing dangerous bacteria. And that’s in addition to the legacy of industrial pollutants that were released on a continuous basis until the 1970s, including PCBs, from factories up the river. Oysters are incredibly productive filterers — an adult can filter up to 50 gallons a day — but they cannot filter out heavy metals and PCBs. “There’s still a ways to go for us to be able to eat the oysters,” Ms. Roble said. But she said the underwater contraptions, which can easily be pulled up to show to visitors, help people to understand the world below the water’s surface, and to feel invested in protecting it. “We want the community to really participate,” she said.

Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Alyson Krueger In the past, Lexi Ivarsson, a content creator who lives in Boise, Idaho, felt she had limited options for the holidays. She would pack her four kids, aged 3 to 7, in the car and drive to either her husband’s parents’ house nearby or her family’s house near Provo, Utah. It was a tradition so ingrained, she even saw family members last year for the holidays, in the middle of the pandemic and against the guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But this year she decided she’d had enough. She and her husband, Brendan, don’t share views with his family on almost anything. “Our thoughts on religion and politics and the way we should treat each other and ethics is completely different,” said Ms. Ivarsson, 28. “Sitting down at a table together is hard because of that.” To get to her parents required a 10-hour drive. “We get along with them, but it’s a big drive to do with little kids,” she said. So this year she decided to celebrate Thanksgiving sans family. Instead she and her husband invited her best friend and her family over to celebrate (and share the cooking). “We had such a good time, and there was zero drama to it and zero obligation,” said Ms. Ivarsson. “I think the pandemic shifted something that made us realize if we don’t want to spend time with family, we don’t have to.” She now plans to celebrate Christmas with friends as well. People across the country are saying no more to holiday obligations. After the drain of the pandemic, some are choosing to skip the stress of travel or of spending hours around a table with people they don’t entirely enjoy. Even those who like their families are choosing to be apart, opting instead to be with friends who live close to them or to go on far-flung trips they’ve always wanted to take. “We’ve all finally realized we don’t have to do things the way they’ve always been,” Ms. Ivarsson said. Throughout the pandemic, many Americans have realized the value in taking care of themselves and doing what they want to do, not what’s expected of them. Megan Vice’s family lives on Long Island and wants her to come home for the holidays, but for the past few years, spending Christmas there has been a bummer. “My parents don’t even have a tree anymore,” said Ms. Vice, a 31-year-old musician who lives in Los Angeles. “I need to be doing things that make me happy, and for me, Christmas is not an enjoyable experience. As much as I love my parents, this holiday does not make me feel good.” This year, she will fly to Chiapas, Mexico, for a 10-day silent meditation retreat in the mountains. “It’s going to be intense, but I think it will be meaningful,” Ms. Vice said. “The pandemic has made me crave not just new experiences, but ones that are intentional.” The pandemic has taught other Americans that virtual connections can be as meaningful as in-person ones. If that is the case, they figure, why spend all the money and time to travel to be with family in person? Tracy Lee, 40, who works in financial tech in Manhattan, loves visiting her parents and siblings who live in Montana, Arizona and Indiana. But Thanksgiving, when airfare is generally more expensive and the airports are packed, is not an ideal time to fly there. “I would rather see my family when we can actually do things and not feel forced,” said Ms. Lee, 40. “Why not meet up in August and enjoy a nice week together and not force this holiday on all of us?” When she was away from her family over the pandemic, she learned how easy it was to keep in touch with them virtually. So she decided to do that for the holiday this year instead. “We played a trivia game with them, some version of Heads Up,” she said. “It feels so natural to interact virtually since the pandemic. This is now how we make the holidays work.” Thom Tran, a stand-up comedian in Los Angeles, said the pandemic normalized virtual connections so much that this year he felt free to celebrate Thanksgiving away from his parents, who live in New York, “completely without guilt.” “My dad is a 70-something man who now embraces the iPhone like I never expected,” said Mr. Tran, 42. “He now FaceTimes me on a biweekly basis,” he said. (Mr. Tran spent Thanksgiving serving meals to the homeless, then eating dinner with 25 new and old friends.) For others, skipping family gatherings last year helped them realize the get-togethers are not that important. Tony Hurt, 31, a software engineer in Columbus, Ohio, usually spends Christmas with his large extended family at his aunt’s house, also in Columbus. “I buy gifts for everyone and I usually spend $600 to 1,000. And it’s not even about the money. It’s so stressful buying gifts for so many people.” The pandemic helped him have a breakthrough. “Since we weren’t able to get together last year, I realized how much money I saved,” he said. “It made me realize it’s not the worst thing in the world to skip spending a day with family I see a lot anyway.” Instead he’s going to Puerto Rico by himself for a week to relax on the beach and listen to live music. “I would have never dreamed of missing Christmas before the pandemic, but now it makes sense,” he said. “I am so excited about my trip.” The pandemic also turned friends into family. When they couldn’t be with their biological relatives, some created a family of friends and neighbors who lived closer. Caragh Creswell, who works in fashion in New York City, chose to celebrate Thanksgiving with one of her best friend’s families. For Christmas, she is hosting friends at her apartment. “We have all gone through such a huge, huge emotional roller-coaster together,” said Ms. Creswell, 29, who is originally from Australia and still has family there. “What the pandemic has taught me is that family doesn’t have to represent those that are blood related. Family is made of those people who support you and love you,” she said. “So when I think about who I want to spend the holidays with, it’s those people.” Advertisement"

Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Jessica Alexander It could have been any January day — the air crisp, the sky clear. But that morning in Tokyo, where we lived then, I awoke with the same heaviness I have felt on this day since meeting my husband, Andy, nearly eight years before. He was already out for a jog. I pulled our 4-year-old twin boys out of bed, opened a box of crayons and told them we were going to make daddy a card. They didn’t ask why, and I didn’t tell them that it was so he would feel our warmth and affection on this day, the anniversary of the worst day of his life. They drew colorful hearts, and I wrote “We Love You” in big letters. When Andy returned, one of our boys ran to the door, arm outstretched, proudly handing him our creation. “Thanks guys,” Andy said with a smile, his eyes asking me: What is this for? “Because it’s today,” I said. “What’s today?” he asked, wiping the sweat from his forehead. “Today. You know — ” It hit him: This was the day that his first wife and two sons died in the Haiti earthquake 10 years earlier. His body deflated, and his face, still bright from his run, crumpled. Then the texts began: “Thinking about you.” “Sending love.” With every buzz of his phone, he would look at me with a pleading face, as if to say: “How could all these people remember, except me?” Of course, he never forgets. He tells me they are with him every day; I imagine their memories like a heavy blanket wrapped around his heart, keeping him warm and grounded. He rationalized that his slip of the mind that day honored who they were, because they wouldn’t want him to still tear up at the sound of children’s laughter, to still be vacillating between sorrow, anger and emptiness. “Forgetting” also meant he was present in a way that was once unimaginable — waking up without dread, going for a carefree run, sitting down for toast and eggs with his family. Our boys didn’t know about Andy’s past. He and I met two years after the earthquake when our work overlapped. In time, Andy and I fell in love, married and had twin sons. As the boys turned 3, then 4, I found myself searching online, “What is the right age to talk to children about death?” I wondered when they would ask about the other two boys in framed photos on our bookshelves or recognize them on their grandmother’s refrigerator — the pictures that didn’t change with each new baseball season or dance recital like those of the other grandchildren. Those two faces never grow up. When I looked at my sons — at their baby teeth smiles and wrists still pudgy with baby fat — I could only guess at who they would be years from now. Andy often wondered the same about his first boys. One recent August marked when the eldest, Evan, would have turned 18. Would he be headed off to college? How would his voice sound? That August afternoon, we had just finished eating lunch next to a lake near our home when Andy turned to me and said, “I’m going to tell them.” I felt anxious, not knowing how the boys would take it, but also reassured by Andy’s calm. We got up and started walking along the edge of the lake when Andy stopped and said, “Boys, I have something to tell you.” They loved his stories and ran to him, each grabbing a hand. “Many years ago,” he said, “when I was working in a country called Haiti, I lived with my two sons and their mom. My sons were just about your age — Baptiste was almost 5, and Evan was 7. Today is Evan’s birthday actually; he would have been 18. One day, there was a big earthquake.” He explained what an earthquake was, tectonic plates and all. “I was at work and Evan, Baptiste and their mom, Laurence, my wife before your mommy, were at home.” When the shaking started, Andy explained, they couldn’t make it out of the building before it collapsed, and the three of them died. I tensed to see if the boys would be scared or surprised, or if it would even register. “What does collapse mean?” one asked. “Look there’s a fish!” said the other, pointing. Andy carefully answered all their questions, then took a deep breath and said, “Let’s go for a swim.” We put on bathing suits and hopped into the cold water, the boys splashing behind rocks and laughing. They didn’t seem to absorb the gravity of the loss, or how brave their father was. It probably struck them as just another story. Back home, we took the photos of Evan, Baptiste and Laurence from our shelves, introducing the boys to the faces they had always seen around the apartment. In the coming weeks, Andy shared details about them that I realized he had been carrying alone this whole time. Soon Andy began working memories of his first family into our everyday lives. “Evan and Baptiste loved this book,” he would say before settling in for a bedtime story that he had read our boys countless times. Or as we gathered on the couch to watch a movie, he would tell us that this was Evan and Baptiste’s favorite. “Did they get scared too?” one of the twins asked. “Sure they did.” One summer evening as we walked home from the park, the boys tugged excitedly at our hands, pulling us this way and that, until Andy pulled his hand away from their incessant yanking. Then he immediately flinched and put his hand out again, later saying to me, “I get so mad at myself for doing that.” “Why?” “Because I would give anything to hold their hands again.” As in that instance, I sometimes overlook how his interactions with us are shaped by regret over things he wishes he had done differently, and his sorrow over things he wishes he still could do. But they are also shaped by the realization that today he has another chance. I often think about Andy’s former wife — I am older than she was when she died at 40 — and how she was robbed of so much life. It shouldn’t have surprised me when the boys did the same about their half brothers. After losing his first tooth, one of the twins asked, “Did Baptiste ever lose a tooth?” And they would tell their friends over lunch about how Evan pronounced butter “buller.” When they turned 5, they wanted to know if Baptiste ever had a 5th birthday party, and they began asking more often for details about what happened, trying to understand. But so much of what happened isn’t understandable. “Why did your house break, Daddy?” “Why were they at home and you weren’t?” “Why didn’t your office fall down?” These questions had haunted Andy for years, but when they come from the mouths of his innocently curious children, he tells me that he can face them more easily, which has helped relieve his lingering guilt. One day they may ask about his despair, and perhaps he will explain the many dimensions of his grief. For now, getting through the facts is enough. One morning after one of the boys’ friends slept over, we all sat down for pancakes when the friend noticed a framed picture of Evan and Baptiste on a seesaw and said, “When were you there?” “That’s not us,” one of the twins said. “That’s Daddy’s other sons, Evan and Baptiste. They died in the earthquake in Haiti when their building fell on them.” “Oh, like when the bear got smushed by the rocks in that cartoon,” the friend said. He was only 5 — what other reference could he possibly have? “It’s not a cartoon,” our son said. “It was real. And it’s not funny.” I had thought the gravity was lost on him and his brother, but he understood. And for the first time, Andy didn’t have to take a deep breath and muster the strength to tell the story yet again. His son had done it for him. This year, the night before the earthquake anniversary, Andy was feeling low, his attention elsewhere while cooking dinner. “What’s wrong, Daddy?” asked our older twin. “Tomorrow is the anniversary of the earthquake,” he said. “So I’m thinking of Baptiste, Evan and Laurence.” “Tomorrow there will be an earthquake?” “No baby, tomorrow’s just the anniversary. And I’m sad.” “Oh,” our son said, then quickly added, “But lucky too, Daddy.” Andy looked up. “Lucky?” “Lucky you found us.” His voice was high and his head tilted, as if asking. Andy looked at me with disbelief. Our boy might not have understood the meaning of an anniversary, but he could comprehend the idea of renewal. Andy scooped him up in his arms. “Yes, my boy,” he said. “I am the luckiest.” Jessica Alexander, editor at The New Humanitarian in Geneva, is the author of the nonfiction book “Chasing Chaos.” Modern Love can be reached at modernlove@nytimes.com.

Inside a Gen Z Conspiracy Theory. - The New York Times",12/9/2021,"The Great Read Peter McIndoe, the 23-year-old creator of the viral Birds Aren’t Real movement, is ready to reveal what the effort is really about. Peter McIndoe, the 23-year-old creator of the Birds Aren't Real movement, with his van in Fayetteville, Ark.Credit...Rana Young for The New York Times Supported by By Taylor Lorenz In Pittsburgh, Memphis and Los Angeles, massive billboards recently popped up declaring, “Birds Aren’t Real.” On Instagram and TikTok, Birds Aren’t Real accounts have racked up hundreds of thousands of followers, and YouTube videos about it have gone viral. Last month, Birds Aren’t Real adherents even protested outside Twitter’s headquarters in San Francisco to demand that the company change its bird logo. The events were all connected by a Gen Z-fueled conspiracy theory, which posits that birds don’t exist and are really drone replicas installed by the U.S. government to spy on Americans. Hundreds of thousands of young people have joined the movement, wearing Birds Aren’t Real T-shirts, swarming rallies and spreading the slogan. It might smack of QAnon, the conspiracy theory that the world is controlled by an elite cabal of child-trafficking Democrats. Except that the creator of Birds Aren’t Real and the movement’s followers are in on a joke: They know that birds are, in fact, real and that their theory is made up. What Birds Aren’t Real truly is, they say, is a parody social movement with a purpose. In a post-truth world dominated by online conspiracy theories, young people have coalesced around the effort to thumb their nose at, fight and poke fun at misinformation. It’s Gen Z’s attempt to upend the rabbit hole with absurdism. “It’s a way to combat troubles in the world that you don’t really have other ways of combating,” said Claire Chronis, 22, a Birds Aren’t Real organizer in Pittsburgh. “My favorite way to describe the organization is fighting lunacy with lunacy.” At the center of the movement is Peter McIndoe, 23, a floppy-haired college dropout in Memphis who created Birds Aren’t Real on a whim in 2017. For years, he stayed in character as the conspiracy theory’s chief believer, commanding acolytes to rage against those who challenged his dogma. But now, Mr. McIndoe said in an interview, he is ready to reveal the parody lest people think birds really are drones. “Dealing in the world of misinformation for the past few years, we’ve been really conscious of the line we walk,” he said. “The idea is meant to be so preposterous, but we make sure nothing we’re saying is too realistic. That’s a consideration with coming out of character.” Most Birds Aren’t Real members, many of whom are part of an on-the-ground activism network called the Bird Brigade, grew up in a world overrun with misinformation. Some have relatives who have fallen victim to conspiracy theories. So for members of Gen Z, the movement has become a way to collectively grapple with those experiences. By cosplaying conspiracy theorists, they have found community and kinship, Mr. McIndoe said. “Birds Aren’t Real is not a shallow satire of conspiracies from the outside. It is from the deep inside,” he said. “A lot of people in our generation feel the lunacy in all this, and Birds Aren’t Real has been a way for people to process that.” Cameron Kasky, 21, an activist from Parkland, Fla., who helped organize the March for Our Lives student protest against gun violence in 2018 and is involved in Birds Aren’t Real, said the parody “makes you stop for a second and laugh. In a uniquely bleak time to come of age, it doesn’t hurt to have something to laugh about together.” Mr. McIndoe, too, marinated in conspiracies. For his first 18 years, he grew up in a deeply conservative and religious community with seven siblings outside Cincinnati, then in rural Arkansas. He was home-schooled, taught that “evolution was a massive brainwashing plan by the Democrats and Obama was the Antichrist,” he said. He read books like “Remote Control,” about what it said were hidden anti-Christianity messages from Hollywood. In high school, social media offered a gateway to mainstream culture. Mr. McIndoe began watching Philip DeFranco and other popular YouTubers who talked about current events and pop culture, and went on Reddit to find new viewpoints. “I was raised by the internet, because that’s where I ended up finding a lot of my actual real-world education, through documentaries and YouTube,” Mr. McIndoe said. “My whole understanding of the world was formed by the internet.” By the time Mr. McIndoe left home for the University of Arkansas in 2016, he said, he realized he wasn’t the only young person forced to straddle multiple realities. Here are more fascinating tales you can’t help but read all the way to the end. Then in January 2017, Mr. McIndoe traveled to Memphis to visit friends. Donald J. Trump had just been sworn in as president, and there was a women’s march downtown. Pro-Trump counterprotesters were also there. When Mr. McIndoe saw them, he said, he ripped a poster off a wall, flipped it over and wrote three random words: “Birds Aren’t Real.” “It was a spontaneous joke, but it was a reflection of the absurdity everyone was feeling,” he said. Mr. McIndoe then walked around and improvised the Birds Aren’t Real conspiracy lore. He said he was part of a greater movement that believed that birds had been replaced with surveillance drones and that the cover up began in the 1970s. Unbeknown to him, he was filmed and the video posted on Facebook. It went viral, especially among teenagers in the South. In Memphis, “Birds Aren’t Real” graffiti soon showed up. Photos of the phrase’s being scrawled on chalkboards and the walls of local high schools surfaced. People made “Birds Aren’t Real” stickers. Mr. McIndoe decided to lean into Birds Aren’t Real. “I started embodying the character and building out the world this character belonged to,” he said. He and Connor Gaydos, a friend, wrote a false history of the movement, concocted elaborate theories and produced fake documents and evidence to support his wild claims. “It basically became an experiment in misinformation,” Mr. McIndoe said. “We were able to construct an entirely fictional world that was reported on as fact by local media and questioned by members of the public.” Mr. Gaydos added, “If anyone believes birds aren’t real, we’re the last of their concerns, because then there’s probably no conspiracy they don’t believe.” In 2018, Mr. McIndoe dropped out of college and moved to Memphis. To build Birds Aren’t Real further, he created a flyer that shot to the top of Reddit. He hired an actor to portray a former C.I.A. agent who confessed to working on bird drone surveillance; the video has more than 20 million views on TikTok. He also hired actors to represent adult bird truthers in videos that spread all over Instagram. That same year, Mr. McIndoe began selling Birds Aren’t Real merchandise. The money, totaling several thousand dollars a month, helps Mr. McIndoe and Mr. Gaydos cover their living expenses. “All the money from our merch lineup goes into making sure me and Connor can do this full time,” Mr. McIndoe said. “We also put the money into the billboards, flying out members of the Bird Brigade to rallies. None of the proceeds go to anything harmful.” To adults with concerns about Mr. McIndoe’s tactics, researchers said any harms were most likely minimal. “You have to weigh the potential negative effects with any of this stuff, but in this case it is so extremely small,” said Joshua Citarella, an independent researcher who studies internet culture and online radicalization in youth. “Allowing people to engage in collaborative world building is therapeutic because it lets them disarm conspiracism and engage in a safe way.” Mr. McIndoe said he kept the concerns top of mind. “Everything we’ve done with Birds Aren’t Real is made to make sure it doesn’t tip into where it could have a negative end result on the world,” he said. “It’s a safe space for people to come together and process the conspiracy takeover of America. It’s a way to laugh at the madness rather than be overcome by it.” The effort has been cathartic for young people including Heitho Shipp, 22, a Pittsburgh resident. “Most conspiracy theories are fueled by hate or distrust or one powerful leader, but this is about finding an outlet for our pain,” she said. She added that the movement was “more about media literacy.” Birds Aren’t Real members have also become a political force. Many often join up with counterprotesters and actual conspiracy theorists to de-escalate tensions and delegitimize the people they are marching alongside with irreverent chants. In September, shortly after a restrictive new abortion law went into effect in Texas, Birds Aren’t Real members showed up at a protest held by anti-abortion activists at the University of Cincinnati. Supporters of the new law “had signs with very graphic imagery and were very aggressive in condemning people,” Mr. McIndoe said. “It led to arguments.” But the Bird Brigade began chanting, “Birds aren’t real.” Their shouts soon overpowered the anti-abortion activists, who left. Mr. McIndoe now has big plans for 2022. Breaking character is necessary to help Birds Aren’t Real leap to the next level and forswear actual conspiracy theorists, he said. He added that he hoped to collaborate with major content creators and independent media like Channel 5 News, which is aimed at helping people make sense of America’s current state and the internet. “I have a lot of excitement for what the future of this could be as an actual force for good,” he said. “Yes, we have been intentionally spreading misinformation for the past four years, but it’s with a purpose. It’s about holding up a mirror to America in the internet age.” Advertisement"

Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Jonah E. Bromwich, Ben Protess and William K. Rashbaum The New York State attorney general, Letitia James, is seeking to question former President Donald J. Trump under oath in a civil fraud investigation, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, an unusual move that comes at a critical juncture in a parallel criminal investigation into the former president. Ms. James, whose office is also participating in the criminal investigation being run by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., wants to question Mr. Trump on Jan. 7 as part of her separate civil inquiry into his business practices. If Ms. James finds evidence of wrongdoing in the civil inquiry, she could file a lawsuit against Mr. Trump, but she could not file criminal charges. Her request comes as Mr. Vance is pushing to determine whether Mr. Trump or his family business, the Trump Organization, engaged in criminal fraud by intentionally submitting false property values to potential lenders. Mr. Vance, a Democrat, did not seek re-election and is leaving office at the end of the year. He will be succeeded by Alvin Bragg, a former federal prosecutor elected in November. And because the two investigations overlap — both Ms. James and Mr. Vance have been focused on whether Mr. Trump inflated his property values to secure financing, and their offices are working together on the criminal inquiry — Mr. Trump could refuse to sit for a deposition once Ms. James formally subpoenas him. Ronald P. Fischetti, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, said in a brief interview on Thursday that he would ask a judge to quash the subpoena. Mr. Trump’s lawyers are likely to argue that the former president’s testimony could be unfairly used against him in the criminal investigation, violating the constitutional right against self-incrimination. If a judge sided with Ms. James, Mr. Trump could invoke his Fifth Amendment right and decline to respond to questions. Still, while that decision could not be used against Mr. Trump in the criminal investigation, it might harm him in Ms. James’s civil inquiry. Jurors are barred from inferring anything from a defendant’s refusal to testify in a criminal case, but the same is not true in a civil inquiry, where Mr. Trump’s silence could be used against him. News of the move came just hours before Ms. James, a Democrat who had announced a run for governor in New York, said that she would instead seek re-election as state attorney general. “I have come to the conclusion that I must continue my work as attorney general,” she said in a statement. “There are a number of important investigations and cases that are underway, and I intend to finish the job.” Mr. Trump has repeatedly referred to both the criminal and the civil investigations as politically motivated witch hunts and has denied all wrongdoing. Mr. Fischetti said that the news of Ms. James’s request had not come as a surprise. “This is what the A.G. has been doing, working hand in glove with the D.A.’s office,” he said, implying that Ms. James’s decision was political and noting that she intended to seek re-election. Danny Frost, a spokesman for Mr. Vance, said that Ms. James’s request was “not part of the criminal investigation.” He declined to elaborate and would not say whether Ms. James’s office had notified Mr. Vance’s prosecutors about the request to question Mr. Trump. A spokesman for Ms. James, whose attempt to question the former president was first reported by The Washington Post, declined to comment. Bruce Green, who directs a center for legal ethics at Fordham University, said in an interview that it was typical for civil investigations to defer to criminal inquiries. Ms. James’s actions, he said, might suggest she wants to put her investigation on a firm footing in case the criminal inquiry does not result in charges. “You don’t want to forgo doing the civil investigation on the theory that the prosecutors are going to indict, and then they don’t,” Mr. Green said. The criminal investigation, which is focused on Mr. Trump’s statements about the value of his assets, has proceeded in fits and starts for more than three years and is reaching a crucial phase toward the end of Mr. Vance’s tenure. Over the last several months, the investigators have issued subpoenas for records about Mr. Trump’s properties, and interviewed a banker employed by the former president’s top lender, Deutsche Bank. Ms. James’s civil investigation into Mr. Trump, which has been underway since March 2019, is focused on some of the same strands as the criminal investigation being overseen by Mr. Vance, and has included scrutiny of similar properties, including Mr. Trump’s Seven Springs Estate in Westchester County. Last winter, Ms. James was able to obtain a number of documents relating to the inquiry after a judge twice rejected Mr. Trump’s attempts to block their release. Some of the documents were relevant to a conservation easement at the Seven Springs property. Ms. James was examining then whether the easement — a legal agreement meant to protect a land’s conservation value — was legitimate and whether the Trump Organization had improperly valued the estate, allowing it a $21 million tax deduction to which it should not have been entitled. Over the course of the investigation, Ms. James’s prosecutors have also scrutinized some of Mr. Trump’s other financial transactions, including the restructuring of the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago in 2010. If Mr. Trump is deposed next year, it would be the second time he has been questioned under oath since leaving office. In October, he was questioned for hours in connection with a lawsuit filed by a group of demonstrators who said Mr. Trump’s bodyguards had attacked them outside Trump Tower in 2015. That deposition has not yet been released, and it is not clear when it might become public. Advertisement"

	The detection of the Omicron variant has brought renewed attention, and a new urgency, to the worldwide Covid-19 vaccination campaign, which experts say remains among the most powerful tools at our disposal when it comes to preventing dangerous new variants.
 
	Most wealthy countries have vaccinated significant shares of their populations and have rapidly moved into the booster-dose phase. But one year into the global vaccine rollout, the gap between vaccination rates in high- and low-income countries is wider than ever.
 
	Poorly vaccinated countries face several challenges. Early in the rollout process, some countries were not able to secure enough doses to inoculate their residents, and many still face shortages. In others, supply is only part of the story. A New York Times analysis of available data highlights the countries where infrastructure issues and the public’s level of willingness to get vaccinated may pose larger obstacles than supply.
 
	Some countries that have below-average vaccination rates are using most of the vaccine doses they have on hand, and some are not. Most countries with high vaccination rates have used most of the doses delivered to them; they are clustered to the right side of the chart above.
 
	If a country is using most of its available doses but still has a low overall vaccination rate, that is a sign of a supply problem, experts say: The country is not receiving an adequate number of doses to immunize its willing population. Those countries fall further to the right side of the below-average vaccination section of the chart.
 
	If a country with a low vaccination rate is using a smaller share of the doses it has on hand, it suggests that demand in the country is weak, experts say, or that it lacks the infrastructure to distribute vaccines. Those are countries that fall further to the left.
 
	“There may be varied reasons for low vaccine uptake,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “The most obvious is just lack of doses, and that would be represented by those countries who use everything they get.”
 
	In the early days of the pandemic, when drug makers were just starting to develop vaccines, wealthier countries were able to pre-order enough to cover their populations several times over, while others had trouble securing any doses.
 
	Now, experts say those early purchases have led to continued gaps in vaccination rates.
 
	“In terms of equity, things are worse than six months ago as we see the disparities in vaccine purchases translate into disparities in vaccination coverage,” said Andrea Taylor, a researcher at Duke University who has studied the purchase agreements.
 
	Wealthier countries, including the United States, have donated more than 700 million doses to lower-income countries, according to UNICEF. Experts say the donations are crucial to improving vaccination rates around the world and slowing the evolution of the coronavirus and, in turn, new variants, which can cause outbreaks in even highly vaccinated populations.
 
	“We are entering a third calendar year of Covid-driven cycles of lockdowns and reopenings, sparked largely by regular and predictable emergences of new variants,” said Benjamin Schreiber, the deputy chief of UNICEF’s global immunization program. “The longer the virus continues to spread unchecked, the higher the risk of more deadly or contagious variants emerging. Vaccine equity is not charity; it is an epidemiological necessity.”
 
	Weak demand simply means that people in a given country who have good access to vaccines are not showing up to get vaccinated. Experts say the reasons people have for refusing the shot vary widely around the world.
 
	“Each country and each community has its own issues and there is no one-size-fits-all approach,” Mr. Schreiber said.
 
	For some, hesitancy is less about mistrust in vaccines than mistrust in their governments, said Kaveh Khoshnood, an epidemiologist at Yale University.
 
	“There are countries around the world where the people just don’t trust their government,” he said, “because the governments lie sometimes, they are not transparent, they don’t really share information with the public at large.”
 
	Others may be more skeptical about where their vaccines are coming from, such as those who have access only to vaccines from China, Dr. Khoshnood said. “The population might be somewhat hesitant or reluctant or not fully trust the Chinese vaccine, because they don’t feel like there’s enough information out there about the efficacy,” he said.
 
	It is also possible for a country to have strong demand and adequate supply “but struggle to deliver those doses to the population because of constraints on transportation, cold chain storage” and other logistical problems, said Bill Moss, the director of the International Vaccine Access Center at Johns Hopkins University.
 
	In countries with large rural populations, the success of a vaccine rollout can come down to the number of people available to give shots. In other words, the “human infrastructure,” said Dr. Sheela Shenoi, an infectious disease specialist at Yale University.
 
	“Similar to what we’ve experienced here in the U.S., any health care delivery system is going to be dependent on the numbers and types of skilled individuals to deliver services,” she said. “Even if there’s vaccine supply, if you don’t have the people to deliver that supply, it’s not going to succeed.”

Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Dana Goldstein The parents of two sisters who survived the Nov. 30 shooting at Oxford High School in suburban Detroit filed a federal lawsuit on Thursday against the school district and its officials, including the superintendent, principal, dean of students, two guidance counselors and two teachers. The plaintiffs are Jeffrey and Brandi Franz, parents of Riley, a 17-year-old senior, and Bella, a 14-year-old freshman. Riley was shot in the neck in front of her sister. The lawsuit, filed in federal court, seeks $100 million in damages. It claims constitutional violations under the 14th Amendment and violations under Michigan state law because the teenagers “had a clearly established right to be free from danger.” The lawsuit also states that school staff members acted in “reckless disregard” for the victims’ safety. A second suit will be filed in state court, said the parents’ lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger. Mr. Fieger represented survivors of the 1999 Columbine High School shooting and has represented victims of the Flint water crisis. Four students were killed and several others were seriously injured in the Oxford shooting. Ethan Crumbley, 15, was charged with murder and terrorism. His parents, Jennifer and James Crumbley, were charged with involuntary manslaughter because the prosecutor said they should have known that their son was a danger to his school after buying him a gun. All have pleaded not guilty. The actions of the school district, Oxford Community Schools, have also been under a microscope. At a news conference last week, the Oakland County prosecutor, Karen D. McDonald, outlined a chilling sequence of events that led to the shooting. The day before the shooting, a teacher found Ethan Crumbley searching for ammunition on his phone. The school was aware, Ms. McDonald said, that he had recently visited a shooting range with his mother. And on the morning of the shooting, a teacher discovered an alarming drawing from Mr. Crumbley that included a gun, a person who had been shot and the words “The thoughts won’t stop. Help me.” Mr. Crumbley’s parents were called to an immediate meeting at the school with their son. They were told to put him into counseling within 48 hours or risk being reported to Children’s Protective Services. They refused to take him home when asked to do so, according to the prosecutor. The school district has said that staff members chose to return Mr. Crumbley to class following that meeting, after observing him behave normally in the guidance office. Mr. Crumbley’s belongings were not searched for a weapon, and later that day, he began shooting after emerging from a bathroom, according to authorities. The lawsuit filed on Thursday says that “Ethan Crumbley posted countdowns and threats of bodily harm” on social media, and that parents complained to administrators about such social media messages in the weeks before the shooting, but that the superintendent, Tim Throne, and principal, Steven Wolf, said the threats were not credible. The suit also states that school officials did not involve the school safety officer in the meeting with Mr. Crumbley and his parents on the day of the shooting. The complaint claims that the principal and dean of students were in the meeting with the Crumbley family, while the district has said that the incidents before the shooting “remained at the guidance counselor level.” In its defense, the school said in an earlier statement that Ethan Crumbley was returned to the classroom because he “had no prior disciplinary infractions,” adding that the counselors “made a judgment based on their professional training and clinical experience and did not have all the facts we now know.” In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Fieger said that he simply did not believe the district’s version of events, and that his lawsuit would force it to provide documentation under subpoena. “They are being coy,” he said. According to Mr. Fieger, Riley Franz was shot after emerging from a bathroom with Bella and a friend. The friend was one of the two girls who were shot and killed. Riley was hospitalized and is now recuperating at home with a neck wound but no other major physical impairments, he said. Years of civil litigation often follow school shootings. But administrators, teachers and counselors rarely have to fear criminal charges, according to legal experts — even when there was some kind of advance warning of potential violence. In the interview, Mr. Fieger said he hoped that expensive lawsuits would force a national conversation about gun control. “We’re the weirdest society in the world,” he said. “If we started to make it costly, we’d make a cost-benefit analysis between this so-called right to bear arms and the cost of slaughter in our schools.” Advertisement"

Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Michael Schwirtz KYIV, Ukraine — On the 30th anniversary of the founding of Ukraine’s armed forces, President Volodymyr Zelensky donned a helmet and flak jacket to tour the trenches this week and announced with great fanfare the delivery of new tanks, armored vehicles and ships to frontline units engaged in fighting Russian forces and Kremlin-backed separatists. The weapons systems may help to maintain parity in the slow-moving war of attrition that has prevailed for years. But neither they nor anything else the Ukrainian military can now muster would be sufficient to repel a full-on Russian assault that Ukrainian and Western officials say Moscow might be preparing. With nearly 100,000 troops now massed across Ukraine’s eastern, northern and southern borders and more on the way, even the Ukrainian officials responsible for their country’s defense acknowledge that without a significant influx of resources, their forces do not stand much of a chance. “Unfortunately, Ukraine needs to be objective at this stage,” said Gen. Kyrylo O. Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence service. “There are not sufficient military resources for repelling a full-scale attack by Russia if it begins without the support of Western forces.” General Budanov outlined his nightmare vision of a Russian invasion that would begin with airstrikes and rocket attacks aimed initially at ammunition depots and trench-bound troops. Very quickly, he said, the Ukrainian military would be incapacitated, its leadership unable to coordinate a defense and supply the front. After that, he said, responsibility would fall to frontline commanders to carry on the fight alone. “They will hold up as long as there are bullets,” General Budanov said. “They’ll be able to use what they have in their hands, but believe me without delivery of reserves, there’s not an army in the world that can hold out.” While Russia could be prepared militarily to launch an invasion of Ukraine as early as January or February, Ukraine and Western intelligence services say there is no indication that Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, has made up his mind whether to do so. In a video call with President Biden on Tuesday, Mr. Putin dismissed concerns about the troop buildup on Ukraine’s border, shifting blame to the United States and NATO, which he accused of threatening Russia’s security by supporting Ukraine’s military with arms and training. Mr. Biden followed up that call with one on Thursday afternoon to Mr. Zelensky, which Jen Psaki, the White House spokeswoman, described as an opportunity for Mr. Biden to share details of his conversation with Mr. Putin and to express support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. She declined to specify any Ukrainian requests that might have been made to Mr. Biden. In Kyiv, Mr. Zelensky’s office said in a statement that Mr. Zelensky had thanked Mr. Biden in the call for his “consistent, firm and decisive support.” It said that both leaders discussed ways to counteract the “hybrid aggression” directed at Ukraine from Russia, but did not go into details. The massing of Russian troops and heavy weaponry on the border has forced Ukrainian officials to face some hard truths in recent weeks. The U.S. intelligence community has assessed that Russia has devised plans for an offensive involving 175,000 troops. Ukraine has only slightly more enlisted soldiers and officers in its entire military, according to the Ministry of Defense. It is outgunned on land, at sea and in the air, with only about 200 aircraft in its Air Force, including transport vehicles, fewer than the number of fighter planes that Russia has deployed already to the Ukrainian border. Russia’s forces include battle-ready submarines and frigates in the Black Sea armed with cruise missiles, and land-based units equipped with Iskander-M ballistic missiles, while Ukraine lacks serious missile defense systems. The Russian missiles could wipe out a significant part of the Ukrainian military in less than an hour, said Robert Lee, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and Ph.D. candidate at King’s College in London, who is a Russian military expert. “If Russia really wants to unleash its conventional capabilities, they could inflict massive damage in a very short period of time,” Mr. Lee said. “They can devastate the Ukrainian military in the east really quickly, within the first 30-40 minutes.” Ukraine’s military is not the pushover it once was. In 2014, elite Russia troops were able to seize the entire Crimean Peninsula in southern Ukraine without firing a shot. When Russian-backed separatists then took over part of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, Ukraine had to rely on volunteer brigades of people who took up arms, with little or no military training, to help beat back the insurgency. But the Ukrainian military clawed its way back, fighting the separatists to a stalemate and putting a stop to the most serious hostilities. It did so with help from Western allies. The United States alone has provided $2.5 billion in military assistance that has included high-tech surveillance and communications equipment and drones. In November, the United States delivered about 88 tons of ammunition, part of a $60 million military aid package pledged by the Biden administration. On Wednesday, President Biden ruled out deploying U.S. forces to Ukraine to deter Russia. But there are more than 150 U.S. military advisers in Ukraine, a combination of U.S. Special Forces and National Guard, currently the Florida National Guard’s 53rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, according to two U.S. Defense Department officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive troop deployments. About a dozen other NATO countries also have military advisers in Ukraine now, the officials said. Under the Trump administration, the Ukrainians, for the first time, were given anti-tank Javelin missiles. Ukrainian forces have so far refrained from firing Javelins on the battlefield, partly from a desire to avoid antagonizing the Kremlin. The Biden administration has continued to supply them, delivering a new cache of missiles in October. John F. Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, said Wednesday that there were no conditions or restrictions placed on the Javelins, except that the Ukrainian forces use them “responsibly” and “in self-defense.” In an interview with Radio Liberty this month, Gen. Oleksandr Pavlyuk, the commander of the Joint Operation Forces fighting the separatists, said the Javelins had already been deployed to military units in eastern Ukraine. A senior Ukrainian military official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military issues, confirmed that Javelin missiles had been deployed to frontline military units a month ago, but had not yet been fired in battle. “The Javelins are there, and if our enemies employ tanks they will be used,” the official said. The Biden administration has remained vague about how else it might come to Ukraine’s defense in case of invasion. In his video call with Mr. Putin on Tuesday, President Biden looked his counterpart in the eye and warned the United States would go beyond the economic punishments imposed on Russia after the 2014 seizure of Crimea should Mr. Putin decide to order military action, according to an account by Jake Sullivan, the president’s national security adviser. What those penalties might be were left unclear, though few expect the United States to commit significant military assistance beyond what has already been provided. A brewing conflict. Antagonism between Ukraine and Russia has been simmering since 2014, when the Russian military crossed into Ukrainian territory, annexing Crimea and whipping up a rebellion in the east. A tenuous cease-fire was reached in 2015, but peace has been elusive. A spike in hostilities. Russia has recently been building up forces near its border with Ukraine, and the Kremlin’s rhetoric toward its neighbor has hardened. Concern grew in late October, when Ukraine used an armed drone to attack a howitzer operated by Russian-backed separatists. Ominous warnings. Russia called the strike a destabilizing act that violated the cease-fire agreement, raising fears of a new intervention in Ukraine that could draw the United States and Europe into a new phase of the conflict. The Kremlin’s position. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has increasingly portrayed NATO’s eastward expansion as an existential threat to his country, said that Moscow’s military buildup was a response to Ukraine’s deepening partnership with the alliance. A measured approach. President Biden has said he is seeking a stable relationship with Russia. So far, his administration is focusing on maintaining a dialogue with Moscow, while seeking to develop deterrence measures in concert with European countries. The lack of firm commitments from Ukraine’s Western backers is a source of consternation for Ukrainian officials. “They need to decide, either we’re allies as they declare — and in that case allies help one another — or they need to say that this is not exactly the case,” said General Budanov, the military intelligence chief. “If the civilized world wants to avoid catastrophe — and this will be a catastrophe for everyone — we need military technical support now, not tomorrow, not the day after tomorrow, not in year. Now.” Those who understand that such a level of support is unlikely have begun to speak darkly of popular armed resistance against any Russian occupation. In an interview, General Pavlyuk noted that Ukraine had up to half a million people with military experience. If the West does not come to Ukraine’s aid, he said, “we’ll start a partisan war.” “Eight years have passed and there are very many people with military experience who are prepared with weapons in their hands to fight,” he said. One senior Ukrainian military official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that if all else failed, the military would simply open its weapons depots and allow the Ukrainian people to take whatever they need to defend themselves and their families.

In November, Ms. Peng took to Weibo, a Chinese social media website, and made the sort of accusation that does not normally get made against powerful people in China. Zhang Gaoli, who was a member of China’s seven-member ruling committee, she said, had sexually assaulted her.

Last month, a group of academics, writers, and activists announced that they were founding a new college, the University of Austin. Finally, Texas gets a winning team. Founders of the university think that there’s too much censorship on American college campuses. Too many professors, quote unquote, “canceled,” too many boycotts of controversial guest speakers. Instead, the University of Austin wants to bring back a wide range of contentious debates. And it’s already sparked several of those. A lot of people have opinions about the new university and the team that’s behind it. But according to the new president of the university, Pano Kanelos. That’s a good thing. His announcement states, and I quote, “We welcome their opprobrium and will regard it as vindication.” Very on brand. I’m Jane Coaston. And when I was in college back at the Big Ten champion, University of Michigan, we were having the same debates around free speech. So I don’t know how much creating a new university will solve these age-old issues. And also, what kind of issue is this anyway? According to a 2020 Gallup-Knight Foundation survey, 81 percent of college students say it’s more important to build a learning environment that welcomes all kinds of speech than one that prohibits certain discussions, even if those discussions are biased or downright offensive. But then we get into the conversation about what counts as offensive because I’m guessing that Pano Kanelos and I might have different definitions. So I want to break down what we really mean when we talk about free speech on campuses with a couple of guys who think about this stuff a lot. Greg Lukianoff — I am the president and C.E.O. of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Education, also known as FIRE. I am also the co-author, along with Jonathan Haidt, of “Coddling of the American Mind,” which came out in 2018. — and Mark Copelovitch. I am a professor of Political Science and Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and I have been on faculty here for 15 years. [MUSIC PLAYING] Mark, you do not think that creating an entirely new institution is going to solve any issues. What are the biggest challenges a brand new institution would face? Because it sounds like if creating a university was easy, people like Jeff Bezos or basically anyone with a lot of money would have done what Andrew Carnegie did and start a university. Yeah, I mean, my general take on this is if it succeeds, it’s going to take a lot of time and resources and money. And it will have to become what existing universities already are. Right? So you have this set of people that are claiming they’re fed up and done with existing universities, and existing universities have all kinds of problems. And they’re going to go set up something new. And among other things, said that professors are going to do all of the admissions process, right? So as someone who is at a university and sort of has seen over 15 years what the bureaucracy looks like, there’s large bureaucracies at universities because running universities takes a lot of work and time and money and careful investment in things that are, frankly, not very sexy, to run courses, to develop curricula, to do admissions processes, to do all the administrative stuff on campus. So I don’t have any sense, really, or confidence that the group of people that are behind the University of Austin really want to do that. There’s a media splashiness about saying that you’re going to found a new university and challenge the existing problems and the existing institutions. It’s not clear that these people want to do that work at a new institution. And if they do, over time, what they’re going to find is the reason we have all of the bureaucracy and the rules and the processes and the budgets that we have at universities is because you need that in order to function. And so I am a skeptic on whether it’s actually going to come to fruition. Greg, you’ve said that you don’t really get the criticism against University of Austin. Why do you think that there has been so much response and backlash? Because I think that for me, it’s about the context in which this exists, and especially because of the people involved with it. Based on the context of this university’s creation, what excites you about it? Sure. Well, the reason why I’m excited about every experiment we do to get out of the current very expensive, very bureaucratized higher education model is because I’ve been defending free speech and academic freedom on college campuses since 2001. And nonetheless, I feel like I’ve been kind of screaming in a tunnel, saying, guys, the situation for free speech on campus is much worse than you think. And of course, we’re disproportionately reliant on these schools like Harvard and Yale or where Professor Copelovitch attended, that, for example, only about 3 percent of the faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard is conservative. So I’m mentioning that to say, first of all, there’s pretty low amounts of viewpoint diversity at a place like Harvard to begin with. I think that recommitting, starting from scratch, recommitting to the idea of having a marketplace of ideas is worth a shot. I think being less bureaucratized because this is something that people don’t seem to get, is that if you’re going to get in trouble on campus, it’s overwhelmingly coming from the administration itself. And I think these are often good people, but they’re even more politically homogeneous than the professor. So I think that just by virtue of being less bureaucratized, that’s a step in the right direction. I think having an orientation where they explain freedom of speech, freedom of inquiry, all of these ideas that most universities don’t even have orientation sessions that are about these counterintuitive ideas that, for example, the Enlightenment was essentially the discovery that, in the grand scheme of things, we’re quite ignorant, and we have to test our biases. And we’re constantly going to be shocked, and that it’s a constant arduous process to simply know the world as it is. So, Mark, I want to ask you, academic freedom means something. It is a specific concept. What does it mean? And do you think that there’s a concern on university campuses like Wisconsin or Michigan that there’s not a commitment to it or too little of a commitment to it? So, no, I absolutely think there is a commitment to academic freedom at the University of Wisconsin. I think about people’s political views, right? Whether they’re left or right or whatnot. And when we think about academic freedom and we think about viewpoint diversity as scholars, we’re very much, most of the time, thinking about this is our field, right, and what are we focused on and what are we teaching and researching. One of the hardest things here is, look, I’m a political scientist. We teach in times of incredible asymmetric polarization between the two parties. And what’s become really difficult with academic freedom and campus speech issues for us as professors is every single professor I know, my friend, my colleagues here at Wisconsin, everywhere else, we take teaching really seriously. We take being as unbiased as possible in the classroom really, really seriously. It’s incredibly hard to do right now in this political environment. I teach international relations to 300 freshmen every fall. I specialize in the politics of international trade and finance. So one of the things I’ve studied a lot in the last few years is the trade war and Trump’s trade policies and things like that. And I can’t in good faith actually teach my students that the way the politics and economics of international trade work is the way the president talked about them from 2017 to 2020 because most of what he said was factually untrue about things, right? And so the problem with academic freedom is we’re trying to make a commitment to the sifting and winnowing what is — we’re scholars trying to figure out what is the, quote unquote, “truth” about how the world works as social scientists. And there’s an increasing disconnect between encompassing all political views and staying in that spectrum of data-driven, evidence-based research. And if you’re trying to be a serious scholar and a serious teacher, it’s increasingly difficult to stay unbiased, right? Because staying within the realm of data and evidence and truth now looks like bias in a way that I think it didn’t 30 or 40 years ago. One of the challenges that we have is there are lots of different ways to have wide ranging debates and discussions. And there are lots of ideas that people find anathema. And so my concern, Greg, and I wanted to ask you, is that there’s a pretty good chance that this university could create a similar bubble of self-censorship that you’re worried that other universities already have. And so my concern here is, how can any university, especially one that is set up by people with this particular context, not create a bubble of self-censorship that we all have? How do we think about this? Why wouldn’t another bubble be created? Yeah, could it be created? Absolutely. I just don’t know yet. And the idea that opening up with it being a place that’s about the marketplace of ideas, it’s about sifting and winnowing from the very beginning, I think that it just remains to be seen if they actually pull it off. And I think that one of the things that I found kind of shocking about the hostile reception that they got on Twitter was, like I said, I’ve been doing this for 20 years, and people are kind of like, well, if you don’t like it, well, start a new university. And then someone’s trying to start a new university, and they’re like, ha-ha, losers. So I think that their dismissiveness towards it is disappointing, but could it crash and burn, like I said? Absolutely it could. But let’s look at some of the kind of common — like the case that I’m dealing with right now. One of the bigger cases over the last semester has been the fact that Dorian Abbot, who was supposed to speak on the existence of there being far more exoplanets than we think, and he was supposed to speak at MIT, his speech was canceled because he’d written an article talking about how he thinks that — he was defending his point of view that you should be picking professors on the basis of merit. And because this was offensive, he ended up getting disinvited for something having nothing to do with the speech. But that’s something like 16 cases we’ve seen just at technical schools, nearly 500 examples of disinvitations at schools. This was just another day at the office for us. So the fact that some of the stuff is causing people to want to look at the data a little bit more, to look at the examples a little more, I really urge them to become more curious about some of these incidents, to see it doesn’t fit people’s stereotypes in the same way they think it’s going to. I just wanted to jump in on the question of could it succeed. I think my corner of Twitter of professors, at least, and the people I saw reacting to it, I think the part of the strong nature of the reaction was what I already mentioned about all the work that actually needs to go in to do a university and I think the sort of, frankly, the hubris of “we’re going to kind of get this off the ground,” or the, “you’re not actually serious, but you’re doing it for kind of a marketing ploy.” But I think the other one is if it succeeds and the founders are really serious about doing the work, I think the view from the academic world is there’s only two outcomes, that this is another Liberty University and it will develop into that. It will be successful, but it will be a very certain type of university with not the viewpoint diversity that campus speech advocates claim to want. The other is it becomes a university that does have diversity, but has to become institutionalized and accredited and have administrators and have faculties and do all the things that, again, all of us do for 99 percent of our workdays, in which case you have recreated over a 10 to 20 or longer year period an elite liberal arts college that looks like all of the other elite liberal arts colleges around the country and probably has exactly the same set of problems about academic freedom and campus speech. Greg, you mentioned earlier I went to Yale and Harvard, and I did a postdoc in Princeton. And look at all the faculty around the world. And it’s true in political sciences and other disciplines. There’s a very limited number of Ph.D. programs that faculty at elite universities end up at. So if this becomes an elite university with viewpoint diversity, it’s going to be stocked by scholars from those same departments across every discipline. And the bias in political views is going to exist, right? So I see those as, if this really succeeds and becomes a serious university, there’s kind of those two corner solutions as outcomes. And frankly, I think the Liberty University one just seems much more likely, given the individuals involved in setting this thing up. I think that this is an important point because I know, Greg, you think about this all the time. And Mark, you have, too, on a lot of different issues. But I think that the media, of which I am a part, tends to center on, like, 10 schools. I know. And I call that kind of an aspirational focus. I’d be interested to hear from you, Mark, how you think that speech and these issues may have changed over the last few decades, but also, was there a time where things were better? And have they gotten worse, or is this just a debate that we’ve been having for a really long time? I mean, look, I was a small town public school kid from a steel town in Pennsylvania. I ended up spending 12 of the greatest years of my life in the Ivy League at Yale and then at Harvard. And it was amazing, and I loved it, but completely unrepresentative. And even UW Madison is one of the small number elite big public universities that are that near the pinnacle of higher education. And they’re not representative. And but even here, the diversity of the students I see across the socioeconomic spectrum, kids from small town Wisconsin, kids from Milwaukee who are first generation college students, working 20, 30 hours a week to get through college. So again, my take on this is the media has not only covered the outlier cases of free speech, but in covering these outlier institutions, it’s basically ignoring the lived experience not only of the faculty, but the students. And the students I encountered, the vast majority of them don’t have time. They’re thinking about, how am I going to pay for school? Am I going to get a job this summer? What am I going to major in? Working on their courses, their extracurricular activities. So it’s not that these issues are not important, but they’re magnified in the media and in American politics as being the central thing going on, on campuses, and there’s this culture clash going on between the left and the right. And on a day-to-day basis, that’s just not true, I think, for the vast majority of students. Just to push back on the idea that this is uncommon — and also, by the way, why you should care about elite colleges, too much of our ruling class — and this goes for both the right and the left, Democrats and Republicans — went to two colleges, Yale and Harvard. These are disproportionately important universities. I think that we’re making an argument about a time when things were better on campus for freedom of speech without updating our information. Because after doing this for 20 years, I have to say, 2020 was the worst year I had ever seen. And one last thing, I call it the golden age myth, myth, that essentially, I get frustrated sometimes when people think it’s a substantive argument that it’s like, well, these people posit that there was some mystical golden age. I’m like, no, actually, I don’t. I know that free speech is always under threat. It’s actually really unusual in human history. But have things gotten worse in my 20 years of doing it? Absolutely. [MUSIC PLAYING] A few weeks ago, we asked you to tell us if you think the world is getting better or worse. And so far, you’ve told us it’s kind of a mixed bag. I get it. For me, I feel like parts of my life are getting a lot better. But I’m really worried about a lot of aspects of American culture and political life. 2021 isn’t over yet. But as it comes to a close, I want to hear your argument. Did things get better or worse this year? I’m talking about you personally, but also in your community or in the world. What are you feeling optimistic about? And where do things feel like they’re really going off the rails as we head into the new year? Give me a call at 347-915-4324 and leave me a voicemail. We may share some of your stories in an upcoming episode. How much of this is a problem that’s fueled in part by social media? And I don’t mean in a “social media created this issue” kind of way. I mean in a way in which people can hear about a professor who’s at a school that they do not attend who says something they do not like and get very, very upset about it. And then they call the school, and then they’re like, I want that professor out. How does social media and these issues, how has that impacted this back and forth? Well, I wrote the book “Coddling the American Mind” with Jon Haidt, and our opinion on social media is it sped all sorts of pre-existing trends up greatly. It was kind of amazing because I wrote this article back in 2006 about this new thing, Facebook, and about how we’re increasingly seeing students getting in trouble for what they post on Facebook. Now back then, they would actually post them smoking pot in the dorms and be like, don’t post yourselves doing illegal things on the Facebooks. But I do think that the social media is an accelerant. Suddenly having billions of people who can talk to each other has accelerated all sorts of change that was relatively slow moving. And so many of our cases, by the way, are, “I said something on social media, and now someone wants to get me fired.” And those cases, we first started with professors. There was a professor at Kansas State University, Professor Guth I think his name was, and he said something after the wake of the Newtown massacre. And he said, may it be your kids next time, NRA. Now, I also am the father of kids, so I understand how that could provoke people. But this is one of the trend of tenured professors getting fired for what they said. But the thing is, it doesn’t just mean that we’re hearing about these cases more. It’s that there are more of them because people get riled up. So this is inextricably linked with social media. Yeah, I think this point of acceleration is really true. As I said earlier with the history of this, I don’t think there’s much new at all about the politics of this. But I think it’s not just the acceleration with social media. It’s that it’s become an active strategy of groups that want to make a certain political point about campus speech. There’s a conscious strategy now of groups that try and get invited to campus. And then there’s an uproar. And they use the uproar to launch a social media campaign making a point about free speech. Or there’s a tweet by a professor that’s picked up in the same thing. And so it’s not just that the technology enables the acceleration and the dissemination of the information. It’s that the outside groups, whether those are politicians in the state, as you said earlier, Jane, or whether that’s private organizations or individuals that want to make a point, are basically organizing their strategy about campus speech by exploiting what they know will happen with social media. Mark, you’ve been working in higher ed for a really long time. Do you think that these debates reflect any actual changes in student experiences? Or are we talking about them more now? When you talk to students that you work with, whether they’re undergraduates or graduate students, what are you hearing? Almost nothing, which might be selection bias, right? Or it might be what I was alluding to earlier of the vast majority of students, this is simply not priority one, two, three, four, six, 10, 12, or 15. Now I don’t want to make the point or the argument that these issues are not important and they’re not happening on campus, but students don’t come to me with concerns about being stifled. Now, again, that might be as a 46-year-old white male that students don’t want to do that, especially minority students or female students. And they don’t want to challenge the professor, and they’re self-censoring. I have no way of actually knowing that. But again, I have been in higher education teaching for 20 years now. And the number of conversations that I have had about this, again, relative to all of the time spent on all of the other things that we as professors do with teaching and mentoring and interacting with students, it’s tiny. It feels like, again, the selection bias is the actors from outside or a very small number of people on campus are pitched as being representative of the main thing going on, on campus. I’m glad you noted the idea of self-censorship. And I’m curious to get your thoughts, Greg, because — Sure. — we self-censor all the time in life. You self-censor at work. We self-censor with people we know. So when is self-censorship just what you do so you’re not weird? And when is it a cause for concern? So when it comes to self-censoring, there are about 80 percent of students self-censor their viewpoints. Now, the idea that people self-censor for reasons that make sense out of politeness and all this kind of stuff, it’s a good point. But at the same time, higher education is supposed to be a special space. And it doesn’t work unless students and faculty alike — and I’m sure Professor Copelovitch can do this — are able to occasionally approach things with some amount of detachment, the idea that you have to engage in devil’s advocacy, that you have to engage in thought of experimentation. You have to take seriously the idea that you might be wrong all the time, which is a very hard habit to develop. And yes, we can say maybe people were just self-censoring to be polite. What we hear from a lot of students — and we also have this in our own data — they’re afraid of their professors. They’re afraid of some of their fellow classmates for something that could have been the kind of thought experimentation or the kind of devil’s advocacy that might have been totally wrong, but it might have led to an interesting idea. It might have popped the bubble a little bit to lead to good discussions. That’s fair, and I agree with a large portion of it. But the social scientist in me who knows enough about survey experiments to be dangerous says the point Jane brought up is a very good one, which is the questions that people ask in these surveys of students don’t actually provide you information that allow you to make the inference that it’s something the university did that has caused this, right? So they tell you about people’s feelings, they tell you about people’s behavior, and they tell you about people’s expectations. But a large percentage of students may feel that they need to self-censor, even in an environment where the universities were arguably doing more to address campus speech issues, right? So I think, Greg, you raise a lot of important points in figuring out how do we overcome this. And people have these concerns, and we should take them valid. And we should try and have that detached discussion. I mean, again, that’s the essence of what we try and do as teachers and scholars, is engage in this type of debate where you have to confront text and arguments that make you uncomfortable and people who disagree with you. But I think from the perspective of a social scientist that often, the way we interpret surveys is different from what the question was actually asking and what the person taking the survey thought they were answering when they answered the question. I think that for many people when they are thinking about speech on campus, they tend to be thinking about the kind of speech that they themselves would like to have. And so we are much more apt to support the speech of people who might feel the way we do about Israel-Palestine or about gender. I know that FIRE has done a bunch of work recently with a professor who has been accused of defending pedophilia and now requires basically around the clock security because they’ve been singled out by the same people, arguably, who are, quote unquote, “concerned about free speech.” This is not just a college campus issue. I think it’s just easier to think about it in that silo. But speech is hard and especially the speech we despise. How do you each think about the use of speech and the protection of speech, particularly the speech that we tend to find anathema? Defending controversial speech or offensive speech is just, it’s part of the job. You shouldn’t be doing this if you’re not OK with people having controversial opinions. But yeah, like Ellen Walker, for example — this is the professor at Old Dominion who we’ve been helping. This was a case where the writing was actually saying that we should have a name other than pedophiles for people who are attracted to underage people, but don’t act on it. So basically, if you call them pedophiles, there’s this assumption that they actually act on it. But one thing that I do really worry about and something that I have seen erode, and particularly in the last five years, is this idea that in your heart of hearts, if you believe something bad, if you’re a Holocaust denier, if you have goofy thoughts about the flat Earth, for example, that you can’t be a good teacher in some other field. And I think that it is a sophisticated idea that someone can have horrible beliefs on other things, but also be really, really good at their job, is something that we should always be reminding people of. I mean, for goodness’ sakes, Isaac Newton was an alchemist. He believed in the occult. There’s endless numbers of important thinkers who were racists, going back, I mean. But I do also want to say this. And this is one of the reasons why I’m concerned about some of the schools that now have diversity and inclusion statements for people getting hired for the organization. Even at unrelated positions in the University of California system, they’re being asked to submit these statements. If you have all of the appropriate correct beliefs, the approved ones that a university has, maybe you’re actually fairly doctrinaire as a thinker. And so I think that someone looking at the low viewpoint diversity at some of these universities among the professor and saying to themselves, you know what? There’s not enough ideological conformity here. I think that’s nuts. I think it’s striking and telling, to some extent, so many of these high profile cases are the ones we were just talking about, where it’s someone who is a scholar in some completely different area has political views — Oh, no. — that are controversial, right? No, but we as political scientists who teach about politics, we’re confronting how we try our best to be unbiased and teach about that topic that is our topic of research. It’s different for me than it is for someone who’s an engineer, right, who has political views. But the problem is, you can’t run a university where you’re fully screening people for all of their political views and also hiring scholars. Thinking about diversity and equity and underrepresented minorities and those sorts of things is incredibly important. And we’re trying to do that. And here at Wisconsin, we haven’t done it well for decades. So it’s something you need to take into account. But at the same time, the way hiring goes is you bring in a bunch of people who think are good scholars and possibly good teachers and mentors, and they’re experts in their field. And they’re going to be tenured because of their research and teaching. And it’s not clear to me how you would fairly go about policing everybody’s political views. But I would also flip that around, then. That’s why I bristle and I think a lot of professors bristle at the idea of we need more viewpoint diversity. What is the optimum amount of viewpoint diversity in the biological sciences and physical sciences versus the humanities versus the social sciences? Nobody knows the answer to that. And if you start hiring and making tenure and promotion decisions based on people’s political views, that gets ugly very, very quickly. And this goes back to the tension I was talking about earlier of running a university and hiring faculty, where the focus on data and evidence and scholarship, where you’re trying to figure out how the world works, and we’re having the types of debates we want to have with lots of viewpoints, but they have to be within the realm of objective reality. If we’re going to have viewpoint diversity where viewpoint diversity means we need more people who believe that mass voter fraud exists and the election was stolen when we know objectively the data don’t support that argument, it’s hard to square the circle with being a university and sifting and winnowing and pursuing the mission of intellectual inquiry that’s rigorous and grounded in data and evidence and having all views on the American political spectrum represented because the American political spectrum doesn’t overlap perfectly with belief in data and evidence and empirical reality anymore. When we’re thinking about speech issues, I think there are a lot of folks who are like, if I am attending Ohio State Lima or Michigan Flint, which it’s actually, Michigan Flint and Michigan Dearborn do a great job. They’re thinking about, yeah, there’s universities with massive amounts of power and universities that can afford to pay Brian Kelly $9 and 1/2 million a year to do something. But there are a lot of universities with a big lack of money to do anything, much less start censoring people. How do you think that those powerful universities could be kept in check? And what do you think could be done that would make universities better overall? So many things. One thing that I always ask people to do is just to write whatever their alma maters is. And just, even if they’re just reassuring them, even if they just got a reassuring email, to write their presidents and ask them to get rid of speech codes, stand up for your faculty and students from the beginning, passing something like the Chicago statement, which is a statement on academic freedom that’s updated for the scenarios that we’d see in 2015. Survey your students to see if there’s a problem. I don’t think you’ll be surprised and disappointed. And have an orientation program that challenges students to enter that mindset of the exploration of ignorance. I think that we should take seriously the amount of overhead that a lot of these schools have. I think it’s kind of nuts that schools that have $100 billion — I’m talking about Yale and Harvard again — are nonprofits. Yale has almost as many administrators as they have students now. If you add in faculty, so university employees, they outnumber the number of students they have. And they’re still, nonetheless, a nonprofit. We see plenty of cases where free speech rights get trampled on at smaller, poorer schools. And honestly, in many cases, they are the hardest cases to fight because they don’t care. They don’t care about being sued. It’s not their money that they’re going to be paying. But they do tend to be less ideological as you go to the more working class schools. Greetings from Wisconsin, right, where we’ve been defunding public education. And UW-Madison has done vastly better in that environment than the other schools, like UW-Milwaukee and the smaller universities in the system, because we’ve effectively de facto privatized a large portion of our operations. UW-Stevens Point, UW-Eau Claire, UW-Green Bay, their budgets — UW-Whitewater, stand up. Whitewater, exactly. They have been cut for decades. Faculty are not replaced. There’s more adjunctification of the faculty. And the budget cuts are now leading to the cutting of the very humanities programs that people who are setting up the universities of Austins of the world, saying these are the types of programs we probably need to have to have a free and open inquiry. They’re not going to be there anymore because there’s very much a s"

By Kristen Bayrakdarian Though she had lost everything in the Camp fire, Therese Rubiolo returned to Concow, Calif., as soon as she could. Ms. Rubiolo had started an organization three years before to feed and support homeless people in her community, so when she and her family were evacuated and left homeless by the 2018 fire, they knew they wanted to return to help others. “The first thing out of my mouth was, ‘I need my pots and pans to go back home and do my cooking,’” she said. Her desire to feed her neighbors, paired with her roots in the rural area, prepared her to help this year, when California faced another devastating wildfire season and large areas of destruction made it difficult to transport supplies. Donate now to the 110th annual campaign of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. All proceeds go to nine organizations providing assistance to those facing economic hardship. Make a tax-deductible donation through GoFundMe. Ms. Rubiolo, 62, who goes by Teri, knew the pain of displacement firsthand. When she fled the Camp fire in November 2018 with her husband, granddaughter, a property caretaker and the family dog, her home, containing a lifetime of memories, including her eldest daughter’s ashes and art, burned to the ground. The next January, Ms. Rubiolo and her husband returned to their community so they could restart their work nourishing others. “We knew that the need was going to be more,” she said. Ms. Rubiolo’s group, I Am’s Garden, is one of over 200 affiliates that the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano, based about 45 miles northeast of San Francisco, relies on to identify Californians who are food insecure and to distribute provisions. Part of the network of Feeding America, which is a beneficiary of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano became Feeding America’s disaster hub for California this year. Though disaster relief has been a main tenet of the food bank for at least a decade, said Joel Sjostrom, president and chief executive of the group, the fire season has come earlier and has been more devastating over the past two years, prompting the need for more emergency food distribution, as well as different types of supplies. To help those quickly driven from their homes, Mr. Sjostrom’s team developed “kitchen-free boxes,” which consist of three ready-to-eat meals, two snacks and water bottles for one person for one day. The needs have been so vast and the destruction so wide that the food bank began stocking cargo containers with kitchen-free boxes and supplies to bring to rural areas. Ms. Rubiolo said one of those cargo containers provided to I Am’s Garden made a difference in her remote community, 90 miles north of Sacramento. “Without them, we wouldn’t be able to do what we do,” she said. In a neighboring state, another member of Feeding America’s network, the Food Bank of Northern Nevada, has had to expand its disaster planning because of the wildfires. “It was a very long, very active fire season, with fires in the size that we have never experienced before,” said Jenny Yeager, director of programs and community engagement for the Food Bank of Northern Nevada. It relied heavily on partnerships and innovations like kitchen-free boxes as it worked to shift supplies and distribution sites to accommodate where people were finding shelter after evacuating. Among those partners was the HOPE Food Pantry, operating out of the Susanville United Methodist Church in Northern California, near the state line. Referencing this year’s Dixie fire, among the largest in California history, the church’s pastor, the Rev. Charles White, said, “Our entire region has been in a train wreck.” When the pantry began in May 2020, Pastor White saw it as a way to combat food insecurity in the area during the pandemic. Over the past two summers, the need to serve those affected by the wildfires became clear. And the effects have not just been physical, Pastor White said. “We’re not talking as openly about the ongoing trauma as I think we should,” he said. Dennis Roberts, the choir director at the church, and his wife, Maryel, said seeing friends in their rural area who had lost their homes in fires this year had been difficult. The Robertses were evacuated twice in August as a precaution. Though their Milford, Calif., home avoided damage, their utilities were affected for several months. Mr. Roberts has found comfort in volunteering at the food pantry. “I realized how good I felt helping,” he said. Over 3,000 miles away, the balm of being able to help their own community amid disaster also propels Dale and Yvette Browne to continue work at their Sejah Farm in St. Croix, where they raise goats, sheep and poultry, as well as grow vegetables. They lost their home and greenhouse in Hurricane Maria, and recovery has taken time. Four years later, they are still living in a container unit. Along the way, they have helped neighbors recover and rebuild, and have made plans to prepare for future disasters. “As you do things, you get life lessons along the way,” said Mrs. Browne, 56. One of those lessons: “We cannot do that work alone when it comes to food security and food sovereignty in our community.” An overwhelming majority of food in the Caribbean is imported, leaving residents vulnerable when weather disrupts the supply chain. While food banks in the Feeding America network have adjusted their approaches to cope with natural disasters, the Brownes have been working with another beneficiary agency of The Neediest Cases Fund, World Central Kitchen, to help their hurricane-prone community. The food supply issues after Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria hit the Caribbean within weeks of each other in 2017 led World Central Kitchen to consider how it could help counteract these effects in future disasters. Mikol Hoffman of World Central Kitchen said that to address immediate needs in 2017, the group began working with small farms on the islands. “Those were the ones that we started buying a lot of our produce from,” she said, “and who we kept supporting.” As a result of those initiatives, in 2018, World Central Kitchen started the Food Producer Network, for which Ms. Hoffman is the director. The network assists local farmers in building resilient local food systems and strengthens food security through funding, training and networking opportunities. When the network arrived in St. Croix the next year, the Brownes applied for a grant and acquired a large freezer-cooler unit and generator, allowing their farm to store food and to continue operations in times of emergency. The Brownes share their storage space with neighboring farms, and they promote the practices they have learned and connections they have acquired. They are currently working to create a learning center to provide technical assistance to other farmers. “It’s all about food security,” Mrs. Browne said. “That is my motivation. To get up and make sure at least I can feed someone tomorrow. And the next day.” Donations to The Neediest Cases Fund may be made online or with a check. Advertisement"

Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Trip Gabriel Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Dr. Val Arkoosh is the Pennsylvania Senate candidate who is often an afterthought compared to the two front-running Democrats, John Fetterman and Conor Lamb. But a couple big recent developments — the chance of the Supreme Court sweeping away Roe v. Wade and the entry of Dr. Mehmet Oz into the race’s Republican primary — may give her underdog campaign new momentum. Dr. Arkoosh, a physician in obstetric anesthesiology and a top elected official in Montgomery County in the Philadelphia suburbs, is trying to pitch herself as a kind of anti-Dr. Oz. “It really does take a doctor to stand up to a doctor,” Dr. Arkoosh told me. “I don’t even know how he still has a license, with some of the stuff that comes out his mouth,” she said of his promotion of unproved Covid-19 treatments early in the pandemic. Dr. Oz, a celebrity doctor who, until recently, hosted “The Dr. Oz Show,”  is well positioned, thanks to personal wealth and high name recognition, to become a front-runner in a G.O.P. field where no one has yet nailed down voters’ allegiance. The contest to fill Pennsylvania’s open Senate seat will be one of the hardest fought in the country in 2022, with majority control of the Senate at stake. Dr. Oz, who jumped into the race last week, is framing his candidacy as a conservative’s response to the pandemic, pushing back against mandates, shutdowns and limits to “freedom.”  Dr. Arkoosh, on the other hand, helped lead an aggressive response to the pandemic as the leader of the Montgomery County board of commissioners. In an interview, she contrasted her efforts to ensure the safety of students in her county to Dr. Oz’s position on schools at the time: During the same month that she canceled graduation ceremonies last year, Dr. Oz urged on Fox News that schools should be open because it “may only cost us 2 to 3 percent in terms of total mortality” of the population.  He later said he “misspoke.” In response to Dr. Arkoosh’s criticism, a spokeswoman for Dr. Oz’s campaign, Erin Perrine, pointed to his success as a heart surgeon and to his TV show and books, which she said “empowered millions to make better health care choices — even if it meant going against the medical establishment.” Dr. Arkoosh, 61, has struggled for attention from Democratic voters and donors in the shadow of the leaders of her primary: Mr. Fetterman, the lieutenant governor, and Mr. Lamb, a congressman. The two men are usually contrasted against one another as a progressive (Mr. Fetterman, who supported Bernie Sanders in 2016) versus a moderate (Mr. Lamb, who won a congressional district that voted for President Donald J. Trump).  Dr. Arkoosh is liberal on issues — she wants to ban fracking and to add a public option to the health care marketplace — but what sets her apart may be demographics.  Mr. Fetterman and Mr. Lamb are both from Allegheny County in Western Pennsylvania. They each argue that they are best suited to make inroads with white blue-collar voters. Meanwhile, Dr. Arkoosh’s base, Montgomery County — the state’s third most populous and the second richest — is ground zero for the suburban shift to Democrats in recent years. In all, Philadelphia and its suburbs in southeast Pennsylvania contribute 50 percent of the state’s Democratic primary voters. “In Montgomery County in 2020, we gave President Biden 66,000 more votes than we gave Hillary Clinton,” Dr. Arkoosh said. “It is where my base is, where my strength is.” Still, J. J. Balaban, a Democratic strategist in Pennsylvania, said that Dr. Arkoosh’s campaign had been underwhelming so far and that she was little known outside Montgomery County. “It costs a lot of money to get known statewide in Pennsylvania, and she appears to be coming up short,” Mr. Balaban told me. “At the moment, she doesn’t have enough funds to win the Philly market, let alone the state.” As of October, Dr. Arkoosh had $1 million in her campaign account, which includes a $500,000 personal loan, and she trails Mr. Fetterman’s $4.2 million on hand and Mr. Lamb’s $2.1 million. Her endorsement by Emily’s List, the abortion rights group, did not seem to have boosted her fund-raising much through September. Even so, the rising prominence of abortion as a potential motivator of Democratic voters in the midterm elections plays to Dr. Arkoosh’s strengths as a doctor. Her specialty means she administers anesthesia to women giving birth and women having abortions. “As a physician who has sat at the bedside of women who have had to make some of the most difficult decisions of their lives,” she said, “there is no place for any politician in those decisions.” Arguments before the Supreme Court last week suggested the conservative majority was ready to reverse or severely limit Roe v. Wade in a ruling next year. “I think this is going to be a very big issue,” Dr. Arkoosh said.  “And I think this is going to be an issue that gets women, and particularly suburban women, out in numbers.’’ On Politics is also available as a newsletter.

32,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/12/10/nyregion/ghislaine-maxwell-trial,Maxwell Trial Live: Annie Farmer Testifies; Jury Sees Epstein’s Black Book - The New York Times,12/10/2021,"Annie Farmer has called Ghislaine Maxwell “a sexual predator who groomed and abused” countless women. The judge allowed one of Jeffrey Epstein’s books of contacts to be introduced as evidence.  RIGHT NOW Epstein’s address book can be shown in court, judge rules. Fourth accuser in Maxwell trial testifies about meeting Jeffrey Epstein. Annie Farmer takes the stand against Maxwell, who she once called ‘a predator.’ A fourth accuser testified as Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial resumed. Three witnesses have told similar stories of being groomed for sexual abuse. Here are the charges Ghislaine Maxwell faces. Four takeaways from the 8th day of Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial. The fourth accuser in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial took the stand on Friday, describing her first meeting with Jeffrey Epstein.  Ms. Farmer said that she first met Mr. Epstein in late 1995 when he bought a plane ticket for her to fly from Arizona to New York City, where her older sister, Maria, was one of his employees. Annie was the first accuser to appear in the trial under her own name. “She had said that Epstein was interested in possibly helping me with my education and this was one of the reasons that he was purchasing the ticket,” Ms. Farmer said. One night, the sisters met Mr. Epstein at his home before going to see “The Phantom of the Opera,” which Mr. Epstein had bought tickets for. Ms. Farmer said she found Mr. Epstein to be down to earth and easy to talk with. But soon after that there was another meeting with Mr. Epstein that Ms. Farmer described in a near-contemporaneous journal entry as “a little weird.” While at the movies with her and her sister, she testified, Mr. Epstein put his hand on the armrest between their seats, caressed her hand and rubbed her foot and leg. “I was very nervous and anxious,” she testified. “I was sick to my stomach.” — Colin Moynihan and Benjamin Weiser  An address book filled with Jeffrey Epstein’s contacts — one of many small blue or black books where witnesses say he kept the names of girls who gave him massages — can be introduced at Ghislaine Maxwell’s sex-trafficking trial, the judge has ruled. Like the “little black book” of the so-called “Hollywood Madam” Heidi Fleiss that revealed politicians and celebrities among her clients, the books have been a subject of intense interest since the Epstein scandal burst into public view. There have long been hopes — and fears — that such contact lists could include the names not only of his victims, but also of prominent figures he socialized with and in some cases was accused of introducing to girls for sexual abuse. But the ruling, issued Thursday, does not mean those contacts will become public. Just one book, labeled as Exhibit GX52, is at issue in Ms. Maxwell’s trial, and in negotiations in federal court on Friday, the prosecution and defense agreed that only excerpts would be introduced, under seal. The defense had argued that there was no proof that the book was one of those that Juan Alessi, a former house manager at Mr. Epstein’s villa in Palm Beach, Fla., testified were commonly used by Ms. Maxwell and others to book massages and other visits from young women and girls. But the judge, Alison J. Nathan, ruled that according to court precedent, the basis of Mr. Alessi’s testimony — years of working closely with Mr. Epstein and his staff — was sufficient to establish that the book was similar enough to those he had seen to authenticate it and support its relevance. Mr. Alessi testified that several blue or black hardcover directories were typically kept in various locations at the villa, containing “hundreds and hundreds of names” and phone numbers. Examining the book recovered from the villa, he said he recognized “many, many, many, many names.” Among them were some of the entries listed under “massage in Palm Beach.” — Anne Barnard  When Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested in July 2020, one of her accusers, Annie Farmer, read a statement to the judge, urging her to deny bail to Ms. Maxwell, who was charged with helping to recruit girls to be sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein. “She is a sexual predator who groomed and abused me and countless other children and young women,” Ms. Farmer told the judge, who ordered Ms. Maxwell detained. On Friday, Ms. Farmer, now 42, took the witness stand in Ms. Maxwell’s federal sex-trafficking trial in Manhattan to tell her story to a jury. She is the fourth accuser to testify but the first to do so under her full name. The previous three asked to be identified by pseudonyms or first names. “My name is Annie Farmer,” she said as she took the stand on Friday, before spelling her name aloud.  Ms. Farmer’s story is already somewhat well known, in part because she has sued Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein’s estate, and she has spoken out in court hearings and to the news media. She and her sister, Maria Farmer, made early complaints about Mr. Epstein’s conduct to the authorities. Maria Farmer has said she went to the New York Police Department and called the F.B.I. in 1996 to lodge complaints about Mr. Epstein’s troubling physical contact and threats she had received, The New York Times reported in 2019. Those were the earliest known allegations made to the authorities about Mr. Epstein’s conduct, but the sisters have said there was no follow-up by either agency. Records show F.B.I. agents came to speak with them about a decade later. In her lawsuit, Annie Farmer said that her sister, Maria, an artist and graduate student in New York, met Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell at an art show, and that Mr. Epstein took an interest in Maria’s artwork and offered to help her in her art career. Maria eventually accepted a job offer from Mr. Epstein to purchase art for him, the suit said. Later, Mr. Epstein offered to help Annie Farmer get into college, but, according to the lawsuit, the offer was only a ruse to get her to come to New York so he could abuse her. The suit describes Mr. Epstein taking Annie and Maria to the movies in New York, positioning himself between them and caressing and petting Annie against her will, without Maria’s knowledge. The lawsuit also says that Annie was 16 in 1996 when Mr. Epstein flew her to his ranch in New Mexico to attend what she was led to believe was an educational program for high school students. After arriving, she realized that she was the only participant in the program. She also met Ms. Maxwell there, who seemed charming and friendly, the suit said. According to the suit, Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell took her shopping and lavished her with gifts, including beauty products and new pair of cowboy boots — part of a process that prosecutors have said was “grooming,” to lower her defenses. Upon their return to the ranch, Ms. Maxwell began pressuring Annie to give Mr. Epstein a foot massage, the lawsuit said. Later, Ms. Maxwell directed Annie to take off all her clothes and lie on the massage table, where she “touched intimate parts of Annie’s body against her will,” the lawsuit said. The next day, according to the suit, Annie woke up to find Mr. Epstein climbing into bed with her, saying, “I want to cuddle,” and pressing his body against hers, leaving her “frozen in fear.” David Boies, one of Ms. Farmer’s lawyers, said her lawsuit was ultimately settled with Mr. Epstein’s estate, in an agreement that required the dismissal of all claims against Mr. Epstein’s employees, including Ms. Maxwell. Mike Baker contributed reporting. — Benjamin Weiser  The sex trafficking trial of Ghislaine Maxwell resumed on Friday morning in U.S. District Court in Manhattan after it was temporarily halted on Thursday when a lawyer fell ill. On Friday, the judge welcomed the lawyers back into the courtroom and began with a discussion about an exhibit the government is seeking to introduce. The fourth accuser, Annie Farmer, took the witness stand shortly after on Friday, the trial’s tenth day. The government may also rest its case after the fourth accuser’s testimony, a prosecutor said earlier this week. Ms. Maxwell, 59, faces charges of recruiting, grooming and ultimately helping Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse underage girls. She has pleaded not guilty. The trial has moved much more quickly than expected. Before it began, the prosecutors and the defense told Judge Alison J. Nathan that it could last up to six weeks. The judge had halted the trial on Thursday after a brief discussion among the lawyers in the robing room. She told the court that a lawyer in the case was sick and needed medical attention. She said the attorney, who was not identified, was necessary for the direct examination of an upcoming witness. Prosecutors on Thursday were expected to call the last of the four accusers who the government has said will testify at Ms. Maxwell’s trial. — Benjamin Weiser  The government’s sex-trafficking case against Ghislaine Maxwell rests largely on the accounts of four women who say that they were sexually abused by the financier Jeffrey Epstein with assistance from Ms. Maxwell. Three of those women have already testified in Federal District Court in Manhattan; a fourth is expected to testify this week. All three said that Mr. Epstein sexually abused them while they were teenagers and that Ms. Maxwell played a crucial role in facilitating that abuse, establishing an initial contact with Mr. Epstein, arranging visits to his homes or giving instructions on how Mr. Epstein liked to be touched. The first accuser to take the stand, identified only as Jane, testified that she was a 14-year-old girl from Palm Beach, Fla., when she met Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein at a summer camp in Michigan. Her family had little money at the time, she said. Her father, a conductor and composer, had died the previous year. Jane said that Ms. Maxwell at first treated her like a younger sister, taking her to the movies and buying her clothes — including a cashmere sweater and underwear from Victoria’s Secret. Later, Ms. Maxwell gave her instructions on how to give massages to Mr. Epstein, Jane said, and he sexually abused her during those sessions. Sometimes Ms. Maxwell took part in the sexual activity, too, Jane said. She said on occasion people gathered at one of Mr. Epstein’s homes would remove their clothes “and it would just, you know, sort of turn into this orgy.” She never told her mother about the years of abuse, she said, “because I felt very ashamed, I felt very disgusted, I was confused.” Kate said met Ms. Maxwell in London when she was 17, introduced by an older man she was dating. Ms. Maxwell had a home in Belgravia, an upscale neighborhood where Kate was living with her mother. At the time, Kate testified, she had just moved back to England from France and had few friends. “I was quite excited to be friends with her,” Kate testified. “She seemed to be everything that I wanted to be.” Kate told the jury that one day Ms. Maxwell asked her fill in for Mr. Epstein’s masseuse, though she had no experience. During the massage, Mr. Epstein initiated sexual contact. That pattern was repeated multiple times over the next few years, in London and at his residences in the United States. She recalled one occasion in Florida when Ms. Maxwell gave her a “schoolgirl” outfit –– a short pleated skirt, white socks, white panties and a shirt –– to wear while bringing tea to Mr. Epstein at he mansion. That, too, led to sexual activity initiated by Mr. Epstein. “I didn’t know how to say ‘no’ to that,” Kate testified. “I wasn’t sure if I said ‘no’ — if I would have to leave or what kind of consequence there might be for not doing it.” When she was 14 years old, Carolyn testified, a friend brought her to Mr. Epstein’s mansion in Palm Beach, saying she could make money for a massage. Once there, Carolyn told jurors, she watched her friend massage Mr. Epstein, then have sex with him. Over the next four years, Carolyn said, she gave Mr. Epstein more than 100 sexual massages for money, during which touched her and masturbated. Ms. Maxwell called her to arrange some of those massage sessions, Carolyn said. On two occasions, he summoned another woman to join the sexual activity. At least once, Carolyn said, Ms. Maxwell participated herself, touching Carolyn’s breasts, hips and buttocks. She recalled that Ms. Maxwell said “that I had a great body for Mr. Epstein and his friends.” She told jurors that she told both Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein how old she was.  Carolyn said she spent money she received for the massage sessions to buy alcohol and drugs and ended up abusing both. She stopped going to Mr. Epstein’s house when she was 18. “He asked me if I had any younger friends, and I said no,” she said. “And that’s when I realized I was too old.” — Colin Moynihan  Ghislaine Maxwell faces six counts in her federal trial, which relate to accusations that she facilitated the sexual exploitation of girls for her longtime companion, the disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The six counts center on the accounts of four accusers. The charges include: One count of enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in which Ms. Maxwell is accused of coercing one girl — identified as Minor Victim 1 in charging documents — to travel from Florida to New York, between 1994 and 1997, to engage in sex acts with Mr. Epstein. One count of transportation of a minor with intent to engage in illegal sex acts, which accuses Ms. Maxwell of bringing the same girl from Florida to New York on numerous occasions. One count of sex trafficking of a minor, which charges that between 2001 and 2004, Ms. Maxwell recruited, enticed and transported another girl — identified in the charges as Minor Victim 4 — to engage in at least one commercial sex act with Mr. Epstein. And three counts of conspiracy, which are related to the other counts. The conspiracy counts in the indictment are more expansive, involving all four accusers and homes in the United States and in London. These charges involve accusations that Ms. Maxwell worked with Mr. Epstein to secure underage girls for sex acts, for example, by encouraging one to give Mr. Epstein massages in London between 1994 and 1995. Ms. Maxwell, 59, could face a lengthy prison term if convicted. Conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors carries a maximum 40 year sentence; the other charges have maximum penalties of five or 10 years. When Ms. Maxwell was arrested in July 2020, she was also charged with two counts of perjury, accusing her of lying under oath in 2016 during depositions for a lawsuit related to Mr. Epstein. In April, Judge Alison J. Nathan granted the defense’s request to sever the perjury counts, which will be tried separately. — Rebecca Davis O’Brien  The jury in Ghislaine Maxwell’s sex-trafficking trial heard from four government witnesses on Wednesday, including one of Jeffrey Epstein’s longtime pilots and the ex-boyfriend of one of Mr. Epstein’s accusers. One more woman who alleges Ms. Maxwell groomed her for abuse by Mr. Epstein is expected to testify before the government rests its case this week. The witnesses on Wednesday served to bolster the accounts of the government’s main witnesses so far — three women who have testified they were sexually abused by Mr. Epstein as teenagers with Ms. Maxwell’s help. Prosecutors say Ms. Maxwell, 59, helped to recruit and groom teenage girls for sexual abuse by Mr. Epstein, the notorious sex offender and financier who was her longtime companion. Mr. Epstein died in jail in 2019 while awaiting his own sex trafficking trial; Ms. Maxwell has pleaded not guilty and denied the accusations. The first witness to take the stand Wednesday was Janine Gill, the human resources director at former President Donald J. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, where Virginia Roberts — who is now called Virginia Giuffre and has been one of Mr. Epstein’s most outspoken accusers — has said she first met Ms. Maxwell. Ms. Roberts has not testified at trial, but a former Epstein employee told the jury last week that he and Ms. Maxwell met her at the resort. Ms. Gill introduced evidence that Ms. Roberts’s father worked at the resort at around the time this encounter is said to have taken place. The second witness testified only under his first name, Shawn. He told the jury that he had driven his ex-girlfriend, Carolyn — along with two other teenage girls he was dating — to Mr. Epstein’s Palm Beach home regularly from around 2002 to 2004. Carolyn, who testified this week using only her first name, told the jury that she began going to Mr. Epstein’s house to give him massages when she was 14, and that those encounters typically ended with a sexual act. She was paid for the massages, sometimes by Ms. Maxwell, she said. Shawn said Carolyn left Mr. Epstein’s mansion with hundreds of dollars after each visit and said she told him about Ms. Maxwell. On cross-examination, he was pressed to explain why he had been unable to place Ms. Maxwell’s accent in his previous meetings with the government. Another witness, Nicole Hesse, said she worked part-time for Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell at the Palm Beach house for about a year, from 2003 to 2004. She said that while she was almost never there at the same time as they were, she had instructions to take down phone calls that came in, on a message pad near the telephone. Some of those messages were introduced as evidence, including several in which “Carolyn” called. The day’s fourth witness, David Rodgers, was the second of Mr. Epstein’s former pilots to testify at Ms. Maxwell’s trial. He walked the jury through flight logs of Mr. Epstein’s private aircraft from 1996 to 2001, showing that he flew Mr. Epstein and others between Mr. Epstein’s various homes and other locations. Ms. Maxwell was on many of those flights, Mr. Rodgers testified, sometimes along with Ms. Roberts. Sometimes, Ms. Roberts flew with Mr. Epstein alone, the passenger logs showed. Some passengers were marked in the book simply as “one female” or “two females” — annotations that Mr. Rodgers said meant he had not been told their names. Mr. Rodgers also testified that he flew a passenger identified as “Jane” — who testified last week that she was abused by Mr. Epstein starting when she was 14. Jane was recorded flying with Mr. Rodgers in 1996, when she would have been about 16, and in 1997, 1998 and 2001, the logs showed. — Rebecca Davis O’Brien"

Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Katie Glueck He met with foreign dignitaries and participated in a spiritual cleansing ceremony. He visited infamous sites of the slave trade and toured thriving local businesses. And he celebrated Hanukkah with a fellow Brooklynite, about 5,000 miles from home. As New York City grappled with a spate of urgent challenges over the past week that will have lasting implications for the incoming mayoral administration, the mayor-elect, Eric Adams, was in Ghana, searching, he has said, for his roots on a “spiritual journey.” For many Black Americans, a visit to Ghana — a country through whose ports millions of Africans passed on the brutal journey to plantations — is a wrenching and moving experience. And Mr. Adams, slated to be New York City’s second Black mayor, has cast his recent trip there as proof of resilience and progress. “My ancestors left Africa with slavery,” Mr. Adams declared at one recent event. “I’m coming home with the mayoralty. And if I do that only for my aspiration, then I failed those ancestors.” But after more than a week away, Mr. Adams has returned to a city that is confronting serious problems of public health and public safety, and a new, sweeping vaccine mandate that he must navigate. He must also jump-start a transition process that has, so far, lagged the pace set by his predecessor. Mr. Adams left town having made no appointments to his future administration — in contrast to Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had announced roles including police commissioner, first deputy mayor and director of intergovernmental affairs by the end of the first week of December 2013. On Thursday, Mr. Adams officially announced his new choice for schools chancellor, David Banks, a sign his transition is accelerating. He opened the event with a direct rebuke of anyone who would question his trip abroad, including, he said, the “tabloids.” “People who criticize this, they just didn’t get it,” Mr. Adams said. “They just didn’t get what my campaign represented to so many people in this city and in this country.” His team insists that he remained heavily engaged in transition work from Ghana. He also kept tabs on New York City politics as his top lieutenants waded into the City Council speaker’s race, a contest that has significant implications for Mr. Adams’s agenda and has become increasingly contentious. “The mayor-elect worked continually throughout his trip, regularly talking with key advisers about the Omicron threat and other pressing issues, while preparing his new administration and planning for a number of major announcements on his return,” said Evan Thies, his spokesman. Few would begrudge Mr. Adams a postelection vacation or question the meaning of his trip to Ghana. But his visit came less than a month before he is to be sworn in to one of the most consequential jobs in the country, and some questioned the timing. “It is very unusual,” said Maya Wiley, a former counsel to Mr. de Blasio and a civil rights lawyer, who ran against Mr. Adams in the June mayoral primary. “What I could say is that it surprises me that this was a trip that could not be taken after the primary, and that it is a very intense time for most new administrations coming into office.” The trip was largely closed to the press, which Mr. Thies defended by emphasizing the private nature of the journey — but it was hardly a quiet resort retreat. Mr. Adams met with politically and civically prominent people, including a former president of Ghana and the mayor of Accra, the capital city, and delivered speeches of his own. Interviews with leaders in Ghana and a review of social media postings show that he spent significant time with the Heritage and Cultural Society of Africa Foundation, or HACSA, an organization that is focused on issues including promoting African heritage and building connections with the diaspora. The group is helmed by Johanna Odonkor Svanikier, a former Ghanaian ambassador to France and Portugal, who accompanied Mr. Adams on parts of his trip. “HACSA’s mission is to help members of the African diaspora return to their roots and learn about their history — a mission that deeply resonated with the mayor-elect,” Mr. Thies said, asked how Mr. Adams was connected to the organization. Mr. Adams was the guest of honor at a celebration for the group, where he encountered officials like UNESCO’s Accra director, Abdourahamane Diallo. “We discussed areas of possible cooperation in education, culture and heritage with the City of New York, from Heritage to the UNESCO’s program on cities,” Mr. Diallo said in an email, relayed through a spokeswoman. A news release from HACSA also said Mr. Adams pledged his support for an initiative designed to connect “diaspora youth” with Africa. Mr. Thies said Mr. Adams paid for the trip himself, but said that as a matter of policy they would not provide receipts. Gabriella Lourie, a representative for the group, said HACSA did not fund the trip. Mr. Adams visited a range of sites of significant historical, economic and cultural importance to Ghana, and was joined on the trip by his partner, Tracey Collins. He spent time at the home of the civil rights leader and activist W.E.B. Du Bois and the surrounding complex, where Mr. Thies said the home’s caretakers added a tribute to Mr. Adams’s mother to a wall honoring Black leaders. “He was deeply moved by that,” Mr. Thies said. Mr. Adams toured businesses that reflect the importance of goods like cocoa to the Ghanaian economy. And he received a new name — Barima Yaw Asamani, a nod to a Black royal warrior — as part of a traditional spiritual cleansing ceremony. The practice was undertaken because his ancestors were forced out of the country against their will, according to one of the elders involved. “He is not the first person who has been cleansed and who has been renamed,” said Nana Semanhyia Darko, the spokesman for the chief of Akwamu state, who carried out the ceremony. “African Americans have been visiting this place, and we have been renaming them.” A central part of Mr. Adams’s visit was a trip to the notorious slave forts of Cape Coast and Elmina Castles, and he stopped at the “Door of No Return.” When President Obama made a similar stop in 2009, he said the experience illustrated “pure evil” and reminded him of a concentration camp. That experience “was an emotional moment for the mayor-elect that gave him perspective on the importance of the challenges ahead for him as the city’s next leader,” Mr. Thies said. Mr. Adams was not made available for an interview to discuss those takeaways and other aspects of his trip. HACSA, however, offered a steady stream of updates on social media. One Instagram picture showed him standing near a cannon at Cape Coast, wearing sunglasses and gazing at the sea with a somber expression. Another image showed him wearing colorful, flowing garb as he posed at a memorial site honoring Kwame Nkrumah, saluting the former leader of Ghana who was at the forefront of the nation’s battle for independence. He toured the site with Nkrumah’s daughter, Samia. “I think it’s good that our mayor is visiting Africa,” said Yaw Nyarko, a professor of economics at New York University who heads N.Y.U. Africa House and does work in Ghana. “New York is a big city, I think it’s one of the few cities where the mayor actually has a foreign policy.” The professor noted the Ghanaian government’s work in encouraging tourists, in particular African Americans, to visit. Asked about Mr. Adams’s claim that the people of Ghana were awaiting his visit as they did Mr. Obama’s, he laughed. “It’s a little bit unfair, Obama was the president, Adams is yet to be mayor; so without a doubt there’s a difference in level of name recognition,” he said. But, he added, “Everybody is anxious to see more connections between Ghana and New York.” One clear connection was on display early in Mr. Adams’s trip, when he showed up at a Hanukkah celebration hosted by Chabad. Rabbi Noach Majesky, the Chabad rabbi in Accra, is from Crown Heights in Brooklyn. He described Mr. Adams’s visit as “a Birthright type of trip.” The New York Post first reported on the Hanukkah visit. Mr. Adams was connected to the event by Ms. Svanikier’s husband, Thomas Svanikier, Chabad officials said. Wearing what appeared to be a light yellow dashiki shirt, Mr. Adams posed before a picture of a menorah, spoke of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh grand rebbe of the Lubavitch Hasidic movement whose base is in Crown Heights, and discussed the “open wounds” of the Holocaust and slavery, according to videos provided by Chabad of Ghana. “I came here to close the open wound of slavery and reconnect with my ancestors,” Mr. Adams said, speaking on a stage bathed in red light. “I’m happy to be here in Ghana with you, showing how great we are as a people.” An electric guitar riffed on the first few notes of “The Star-Spangled Banner” as another day for a mayor-elect abroad came to a close.

Now the planet is getting its own in case it self-destructs. Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Livia Albeck-Ripka In a remote part of Australia, a steel vault about the size of a school bus will record the Earth’s warming weather patterns. It will listen to what we say and do. It will create an archive that could be critical to piecing together the missteps, its creators say, should humanity be destroyed by climate change. The vault, known as Earth’s Black Box, will be constructed in Tasmania, an Australian island state off the south coast. It will operate much like a plane’s flight recorder, which records an aircraft’s final moments before crashing. But the makers of this new black box — including data researchers from the University of Tasmania, artists and architects — say they hope it won’t have to be opened. “I’m on the plane; I don’t want it to crash,” said Jim Curtis, the executive creative director of an Australian advertising agency where the project was conceived. “I really hope that it’s not too late.” Many questions remain, such as whether Earth really needs a black box and how future generations would decipher it. Mr. Curtis said the box would be designed “to hold our leaders to account.” He added, “If civilization does crash, this box will survive with a completely objective data story.” Climate change is one of the gravest threats humanity faces, scientists say. It is exacerbating economic and health inequalities, increasing the frequency and intensity of natural disasters and, the United Nations has warned, threatens the world’s food supply. In November, negotiators at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow reached a consensus that all countries had to act more swiftly to prevent a catastrophic rise in world temperatures. Scientists have warned that if they rise beyond a threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, the risk of disasters like water shortages, deadly heat waves and ecosystem collapse will grow immensely. (The world has already warmed by 1.1 degrees Celsius.) And so some conceived of a black box. The project is not alone in its attempt to jolt human beings out of what the creators suggest is short-term thinking about global warming. It is not the first to try to salvage pieces of human civilization for posterity. Scientists have built repositories for everything from essential food crops to glacier ice to frozen animal embryos, some of them already extinct. Others have tried to hide our nuclear waste so that future generations can avoid the deathly toxic material. The box’s creators say it will record leaders’ actions (or inaction) by scraping the internet for keywords relating to climate change from newspapers, social media and peer-reviewed journals. It will collect daily metrics, including average oceanic and land temperatures, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and biodiversity loss. The vault — a 33-foot-long box made of three-inch thick steel — is not expected to be completed until the middle of next year. But creators say they have already begun to gather information. Eventually, the data will be stored on a giant, automated, solar-powered hard drive with a capacity to collect information for about 50 years.  Tasmania was chosen for its relative geopolitical and environmental safety, and the monolith will be designed to be resilient against threats including cyclones, earthquakes and, with its sloped walls, attacks by vandals. David Midson, general manager of the local council overseeing much of Tasmania’s rugged west coast, where the box will be constructed, said the response from residents to the project had been largely positive. “There has been a lot of curiosity and interest around the box,” Mr. Midson said, adding that though permits were yet to be approved, he was optimistic. Some scientists doubt that climate change will wipe us out completely. Noah Diffenbaugh, a climate scientist at Stanford University, who says that though the effects of climate change are extremely grave, “it would be a real mistake to confuse whether or not climate change poses an extinction risk to humans with whether or not climate change poses a very real, present and intensifying risk to humans and to ecosystems.” “There’s very little evidence,” Professor Diffenbaugh stressed, “that global warming threatens the survival of the human species.” A more likely scenario if humans do not significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he added, would be a world in which some places disappear below sea level, many others become too hot for humans to comfortably inhabit, and hazards like heat waves, droughts and storms become more common. Some also note that climate change data are already being recorded by scientists and other researchers. “It’s not easily accessible or comprehensible to most people,” Daniel Kevles, a historian of science at Yale University, said of the black box. Though it may have some merit as a document for the future, he added, “I’m not all that impressed with regard to its consequential impact for warning us.” Though the information can be found elsewhere, the creators insist, it is not stored for posterity in one immutable place. How will future visitors retrieve the contents of the box? The creators say they are working on it. One option is to encode the contents in various formats, such as in script or binary code that would be unraveled. The creators say that if the planet is nearing cataclysm, instructions for opening the box would be etched on its exterior. The message can’t be included beforehand, they say, because of the risk that vandals would attempt to crack it open. “It’s in Beta,” said Michael Ritchie, who runs a production company based in Sydney, Australia, that is managing the project. For now, “people are on notice,” Mr. Ritchie said, adding, “We want to make sure that we don’t crash this earth.” Advertisement"

Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Charlie Savage WASHINGTON — The House on Thursday passed a sweeping package of constraints on presidential power, which Democrats framed as a response to Donald J. Trump’s norm-busting presidency and Republicans opposed for the same reason. By a nearly party-line vote of 220 to 208, the House approved the Protecting Our Democracy Act, which would impose new curbs on executive power. Proponents of tighter government ethics have long sought many of the measures, and Republicans have supported them, but they have been recast as partisan issues because of their association with Mr. Trump. “Disturbingly, the last administration saw our democracy in crisis with a rogue president who trampled over the guardrails protecting our Republic,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. “Now, Congress has the solemn responsibility and opportunity to safeguard our democracy, ensuring that past abuses can never be perpetrated by any president of any party.” The legislation would require presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns, which Mr. Trump refused to do. The act would also strengthen the Constitution’s previously obscure ban on presidents taking emoluments, or payments, by extending anticorruption prohibition to commercial transactions. Mr. Trump’s refusal to divest from his hotels raised the question of whether lobbyists and other governments that began paying for numerous rooms at Trump resorts — and sometimes not using them — were trying to purchase his favor. The bill would also require campaigns to report any offers of foreign assistance to the F.B.I. — a proposal that resonates with episodes unearthed in the Russia investigation, such as when Donald Trump Jr. and other senior campaign officials met at Trump Tower with Russians they were told had dirt on Hillary Clinton. The package now moves to the Senate, where the 60-vote threshold for passing legislation means that Republicans can block it. Representative James Comer, the Kentucky Republican who managed his party’s side of the House debate, said there was “no apparent path for the bill in the Senate.” But supporters of the bill envision breaking it up and attaching different components to other legislation in the Senate in a bid to regain bipartisan backing for elements that Republicans have supported in the past. Among many other things, the bill would make it harder for presidents to bestow pardons in briberylike contexts. It would create new protections against firing inspectors general without a good reason or retaliating against whistle-blowers. And it would constrain a president’s ability to spend or secretly freeze funds contrary to congressional appropriations. It would also speed up lawsuits over congressional subpoenas so that stonewalling by the executive branch cannot run out the clock on oversight efforts; require the Justice Department to give Congress logs of contacts with White House officials; and strengthen the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from engaging in campaign politics at work. The legislation’s path has also been slowed by uncertainty among Senate Democrats about the Biden administration’s support. The White House on Thursday morning issued a statement of administration policy that supported the bill, citing “the formidable, but essential, challenge of reinforcing the norms and safeguards that prevent our democracy from eroding.” Ian Bassin, a founder and the executive director of Protect Democracy, which supports the bill and worked with House Democrats on developing some of its provisions, praised the White House for supporting the legislation even though it would curb executive authority. “The Biden administration deserves major credit here for doing something executives rarely do: agreeing to support legislative curbs on their own power,” Mr. Bassin said, adding: “Now that the White House has announced its support, it needs to work with the Senate promptly to enact these provisions.” Still, the White House statement was not unqualified. It included a vague caveat that the administration would continue to work with Congress to ensure the bill would uphold “the longstanding interests of the executive branch that are essential to effective governance and efficient use of taxpayer resources and consistent with our constitutional structure” without specifying any particular provisions it had concerns about. The White House had spent months negotiating with House Democrats, who dropped some of their original ideas in response to its constitutional or policy objections before introducing the package in September. But Democratic lawmakers insisted on keeping some provisions with which the administration had expressed concerns, according to people familiar with the matter, including making it harder for presidents to fire inspectors general. Throughout a nearly four-hour debate on the bill and amendments, House Democrats portrayed its provisions as necessary to fix weaknesses in the American system of separation of powers that the Trump administration had exposed. “Our system was founded upon a respect for the rule of law and a carefully constructed balance of powers among the three branches,” said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the bill’s chief sponsor. “That system has throughout history been tested. And just as after Watergate, Congress worked to enact reforms, so we must now examine the cracks in the democratic foundation and address them. That’s what this bill does.” Republicans portrayed it as a partisan attack on Mr. Trump, while oscillating between denouncing Trump-related investigations and raising other matters such as inflation, violent crime, illegal immigration, gas prices and voter fraud fears. “This bill is nothing but a continuation of the Democrats’ obsession with President Trump,” said Representative Mary Miller, Republican of Illinois. Democrats offered a muddled message about whether they wanted the bill to be seen as concerning Mr. Trump. They insisted at times that it was about the future, emphasizing that he was no longer president and that many elements of the bill had Republican support in other contexts. “Joe Biden is our president now,” said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, who managed her party’s side of the debate. She added: “And these bold, good government reforms will impact his administration, as well as future presidents of both parties. It is not about the past; it is about the future and the strengthening of our democracy.” But Democrats also kept emphasizing abuses of the Trump era — and lawmakers on both sides raised the possibility that he might run for president again. Interpreting the bill partly as a referendum on Mr. Trump’s actions proved to be an inescapable political reality. “Setting aside the Democrats’ neurotic obsession with all things Donald Trump, this measure has many provisions that would receive bipartisan support if the bill’s author were so inclined,” said Representative Tom McClintock, Republican of California.

Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Margot Sanger-Katz Three weeks before a new ban on surprise medical billing is set to start, hospital and doctor groups have filed suit to block part of it. The suit, from the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and a handful of individual hospitals and providers, argues that regulators in the Biden administration have misread the law’s language — and that their faulty interpretation will harm medical providers. The lawsuit does not seek to gut the law’s consumer protections, but could influence contract negotiations between insurers and health care providers. If successful, the lawsuit could influence which doctors and hospitals choose to go in network with insurers, and could lead to higher insurance premiums. Other parties, including consumer groups, employers, insurance companies and members of Congress who wrote the law, have supported the regulation. The bipartisan law, which passed after years of study and negotiation in Congress, is meant to prevent patients from getting a surprise bill from a doctor who doesn’t take their insurance when they visit a hospital that does accept it. It addresses a significant problem in the health system: Nearly 20 percent of patients who visit an emergency room are treated by an out-of-network provider, according to several studies. High shares of patients are also vulnerable to such bills when they are treated by anesthesiologists, pathologists or radiologists whom they did not select. The legislation, which bans surprise bills starting Jan. 1, prevents such doctors from billing patients directly. When the doctor and the insurance company can’t agree on a fair price, the law establishes an arbitration system in which the parties can seek a decision from a neutral expert. The law specifies that the arbiter should look to a typical price paid to doctors covered by insurance — the median in-network price. And the arbiter is expected to consider other factors, such as the doctor’s experience, the number of other providers nearby, and the severity of the patient’s illness. In their lawsuit, the medical providers say the Biden administration’s instructions for arbiters lean too heavily on the typical price; they think the arbiter should be free to weigh all of the different factors equally. “The departments have no authority to discard Congress’s judgment that training and experience are important considerations in determining the appropriate payment rate, even if they disagree with it,” the lawsuit says. Doctors and hospitals lobbied furiously when Congress was considering the legislation, helping to scuttle an earlier bill that would have required the typical price without allowing an arbitration process. A dark money group funded by large physician practices spent tens of millions of dollars on television ads and direct mail to voters, encouraging them to tell their legislators not to support the bill. When the final version of the legislation was passed with the arbitration option added, it was applauded by both insurers and medical providers. As regulators at the Department of Health and Human Services, the Treasury Department and the Department of Labor have worked on the rules, industry lobbying on all the details has continued. In a comment supporting the regulation, the Business Group on Health, which represents large employers, called the rule “a thoughtful and balanced approach to the interests of the various stakeholders.” In its supportive comments, the American Heart Association said the rule “will produce reliable and consistent results that do not have an inflationary impact on health care costs.” The Congressional Budget Office noted that the solution was likely to lower payments to doctors who worked in specialties where surprise billing was widespread. People involved in the fight over surprise billing said they were not surprised about the lawsuit. “There’s a lot of money at stake here, and it’s not at all surprising that the provider groups would sue in order to hold onto some of the payments they are receiving today,” said Matthew Fiedler, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. According to the lawsuit, the regulation will discourage insurers from reaching agreements with doctors and hospitals, and will instead push them to seek lower payments through routine use of arbitration. The suit includes affidavits from two hospital executives who say they are confident the regulations will cause insurers to cancel contracts or demand that hospitals lower their fees. The lawsuit asks a court to eliminate the instructions about the weighing of factors. Consumer protections would remain in effect if they won. Mr. Fiedler offered a contrasting view from the doctors, saying a less predictable arbitration process could lead to fewer clinicians who are in network, as more of them rely on arbiters to settle payment disputes. Some members of Congress who worked on the legislation have offered similar criticisms of the regulation, saying it was not what they intended when the wrote the bill. But other key authors have endorsed the regulatory approach. In order to win the suit, the medical providers will need to show that the Biden administration was “arbitrary” or “capricious” in its interpretation of the law or that it lacked statutory authority, a high standard. The language of the legislation says arbiters should consider the various factors, but does not specify how they should be weighed. Advertisement"

He retired in June. Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Livia Albeck-Ripka Demaryius Thomas, a former star wide receiver for the Denver Broncos who played for the National Football League for 10 seasons before retiring in June, died at his home in Roswell, Ga., on Thursday. He was 33.  His death was confirmed by a spokesman for the Roswell Police Department, who said in an email, “Preliminary information is that his death stems from a medical issue.” The N.F.L. described Mr. Thomas as a “standout” player. He played with the league for a decade, primarily with the Broncos, where he was a five-time Pro Bowler. In 2016, Mr. Thomas helped lead the Broncos to an unexpected victory against the Carolina Panthers in the 50th Super Bowl. In a statement, the Broncos said he “established himself as a dominant record-setting wide receiver who was an instrumental part of two championship runs and our victory in Super Bowl 50.” We are devastated and completely heartbroken.Demaryius' humility, warmth, kindness and infectious smile will always be remembered by those who knew him and loved him. pic.twitter.com/0GLZIr6UP3 Mr. Thomas was selected among the Top 100 N.F.L. players four times and was the Broncos’ second-leading receiver. He was traded to the Houston Texans during the 2018 season and later moved to the New York Jets before ending his career. By then, he had caught 724 passes for 9,763 yards and 63 touchdowns. Mr. Thomas was born on Dec. 25, 1987, in Montrose, Ga., to Bobby Thomas and Katina Stuckey Smith.  According to a biography of Mr. Thomas on the Denver Broncos’ website, his mother and his grandmother Minnie Pearl Thomas were arrested on drug-distribution charges when he was 11. His father was serving in the Army in Kuwait at the time, according to local news reports. His mother was sentenced to 20 years in prison and his grandmother to life without parole. In 2015, President Barack Obama commuted his mother’s sentence. She later wrote about expressing regret for the crime and seeking freedom for her mother, who was still in prison. “Because I refused to testify against my mother,” she wrote, “I received a 20-year mandatory sentence because I did not give ‘substantial assistance’ to the prosecution.” The following year, Mr. Thomas met the president at the White House, according to the Broncos’ website. “We talked for a quick second,” he said. “I told him, ‘Thank you for what you’ve done for my family,’ for giving my mother clemency.” In 2016, Mr. Obama commuted the sentence for Mr. Thomas’s grandmother, after she had spent 16 years in federal prison. Mr. Thomas said at the time: “This was a blindside shot, but I’m happy. I’m excited. The past two years, I got my grandmother and my mother out. And a lot of other people got their family members out that didn’t do crazy crimes, so it’s a blessing.” A cousin, Latonya Bonseigneur, said Mr. Thomas is survived by his parents; two brothers, DeAndre and Brayden; and four sisters, Trenice Thomas, Tonecia Hightower, Tyeshia Smith and Wynter Rose Thomas.  Jeff Clayton, who coached Mr. Thomas when he was a student at West Laurens High School in Dexter, Ga., said in an interview that as a teenager, Mr. Thomas had showed talent both as a football and a basketball player, but that he “didn’t want to be in the spotlight.” Later in his career, Mr. Thomas would return to the high school to visit students, Mr. Clayton said. “Everybody would gravitate towards him,” he recalled. But “he never really changed from that humble little kid,” he added. Mr. Thomas attended Georgia Tech, where he was drafted by the Broncos as the 22nd pick.  In June, when he announced his retirement in a video posted on the Broncos’ Twitter feed, he said: “I’m going to retire a Denver Bronco. I’m honored; I’m grateful; I’m appreciative.” In the video, Mr. Thomas recalled his first touchdown with the N.F.L. “Every time I see it, every time I watch it, I still get the chills,” he said, adding, “I’m just happy to say I’m done and it did me well.” Johnny Diaz contributed reporting.

Muratov of Russia called for peace, democratic renewal and support for a free press. Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Valerie Hopkins MOSCOW — The two journalists awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, Maria Ressa and Dmitri A. Muratov, used their acceptance speeches on Friday to express alarm about the threats to democracies and call for greater accountability for social media companies that Ms. Ressa said are dividing and radicalizing societies. The speeches by the two journalists contained dire warnings that the world is headed toward more violence and misery without a renewed commitment to democracy and the values connected to it: truth, peace and human rights. Ms. Ressa, 58, the first Nobel laureate from the Philippines, is the chief executive of Rappler, a digital news organization that is known for its investigations into President Rodrigo Duterte’s brutal five-year war on drugs. In her speech, she said social media companies still operated with impunity. “Silicon Valley’s sins came home to roost in the United States on Jan. 6 with mob violence on Capitol Hill,” she said. “These American companies controlling our global information ecosystem are biased against facts, biased against journalists,” she said. “They are — by design — dividing us and radicalizing us.” Mr. Muratov, 60, has been the editor in chief of Novaya Gazeta, Russia’s most fearless national newspaper, for more than 25 years. He made an impassioned plea against an escalation of violence, condemning the “militaristic rhetoric” prevalent in Russian state controlled media. His remarks — coming as Russia has massed nearly 100,000 troops across Ukraine’s borders, raising concerns of an invasion — were meant to serve as an urgent warning. “The powerful actively promote the idea of war,” he said. “Aggressive marketing of war affects people and they start thinking that war is acceptable.” At the same time, he said, the ideas of liberal democracy are under threat. “The world has fallen out of love with democracy,” Mr. Muratov lamented in his speech. “The world has become disappointed with the elites in power. The world has begun to turn to dictatorship.” Ms. Ressa has long been an outspoken critic of the authoritarian leader in her homeland, Mr. Duterte, whose government has filed seven criminal charges against her, including for cyber libel and tax evasion. She has been an outspoken critic of social networks for spreading disinformation and hatred. “Our greatest need today is to transform that hate and violence, the toxic sludge that’s coursing through our information ecosystem, prioritized by American internet companies that make more money by spreading that hate and triggering the worst in us,” Ms. Ressa said in her speech.  Since it started in January 2012, Rappler has become one of the Philippines’ most popular and influential media platforms, mixing reporting with calls for social activism. Rappler’s reporters, most of whom are in their 20s, have investigated Mr. Duterte’s extrajudicial campaign to kill people suspected of dealing or using drugs, documented the spread of government disinformation on Facebook, and reported on malfeasance among his top advisers. Mr. Muratov has dedicated the prize to his slain colleagues at Novaya Gazeta. Six of the paper’s journalists or contributors died under his watch, including Anna Politkovskaya, whose 2006 murder in the elevator of her apartment block has never been solved. When the award was announced, he also said that opposition politician Aleksei A. Navalny, who was poisoned last year and has been in jail since January, deserved to have received it. Mr. Muratov is the third Russian to win the Nobel Peace Prize, after the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and the physicist and dissident Andrei D. Sakharov, who won in 1975 for his human rights advocacy. He waded directly into the issue that has gripped leaders across the Western world in recent weeks: the threat of a military conflagration in the heart of Europe. “In the heads of some crazy geopoliticians, a war between Russia and Ukraine is not something impossible any longer,” he warned. “But I know that wars end with identifying soldiers and exchanging prisoners,” he said, referencing his newspaper’s role in identifying soldiers and exchanging prisoners during the Chechen war. He also spoke about political repression and torture in contemporary Russia. “We hear more and more often about torture of convicts and detainees,” he said. “People are being tortured to the breaking point, to make the prison sentence even more brutal. This is barbaric.” He said he would present an initiative to set up “an international tribunal against torture, which will have the task to gather information on torture in different parts of the world and different countries, and to identify the executioners and the authorities involved in such crimes.” Ms. Ressa and Mr. Muratov were the first journalists to receive the Nobel Peace Prize since 1935, when it was awarded to Carl von Ossietzky, a German who was afterward detained in a Nazi concentration camp and later died. “By giving this to journalists today, the Nobel committee is signaling a similar historical moment, another existential point for democracy,” Ms. Ressa declared. “We’re at a sliding-door moment, where we can continue down the path we’re on and descend further into fascism, or we can each choose to fight for a better world.” In both laureates’ home countries, the climate for independent journalism is dire. In 2020, a global survey of press freedoms by Reporters Without Borders ranked the Philippines 138th out of 180 countries. Russia was 150th. After Ms. Ressa arrived in Oslo to attend the Nobel ceremony, she heard the news that a former colleague, Jesus Yutrago Malabanan, a prominent Philippine reporter who had investigated Mr. Duterte’s drug war, had been shot in the head and killed. Ms. Ressa, in her remarks, said she spoke as a “representative of every journalist around the world who is forced to sacrifice so much to hold the line, to stay true to our values and mission: to bring you the truth and hold power to account.” She called on the audience to ask themselves “What are you willing to sacrifice for the truth?” Jason Gutierrez contributed reporting from Manila.

She was the first woman nominated for a best director Oscar. Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By William Grimes Lina Wertmüller, who combined sexual warfare and leftist politics in the provocative, genre-defying films “The Seduction of Mimi,” “Swept Away” and “Seven Beauties,” which established her as one of the most original directors of the 1970s, died overnight at her home in Rome, the Italian Culture Ministry and the news agency LaPresse said on Thursday. She was 93. The culture minister, Dario Franceschini, said in a statement that Ms. Wertmüller’s “class and unmistakable style” had left its mark on Italian and world cinema. “Grazie, Lina,” he said. She was the first woman to receive an Academy Award nomination for best director, for “Seven Beauties” (1975). Ms. Wertmüller, an Italian despite the German-sounding last name, burst onto the cinematic scene with a series of idiosyncratic films that propelled her to the front rank of European directors. All the movies had screenplays written by her, and most relied on the talents of her two favorite actors: Giancarlo Giannini, usually cast as a hapless male chauvinist victimized by the injustices of Italian society and baffled by women, and Mariangela Melato as the always difficult and complicated love interest. In the broad sense, Ms. Wertmüller was a political filmmaker, but no one could ever quite figure out what the politics were. A lively sense of human limitations tempered her natural bent toward anarchy. Struggle was noble and the social structure rotten, but the outcome was always in doubt. Antiquated codes of honor undo the title character in “The Seduction of Mimi,” a dimwitted Sicilian laborer, played by Mr. Giannini, whose neglected wife stages a sexual revolt. In “Swept Away” (1974), Ms. Wertmüller upended the Italian power structure by giving the humble deckhand Gennarino (Mr. Giannini again) absolute power over the rich and arrogant Raffaella (Ms. Mercato) after a shipwreck. After being dominated and abused, Gennarino turns the tables, and Raffaella becomes his adoring slave — until the two are rescued, and the old order reasserts itself. Feminists objected. With a characteristic bit of obfuscation, Ms. Wertmüller explained that since Raffaella embodies bourgeois society, “therefore she represents the man.” In “Seven Beauties” (1975), Ms. Wertmüller again courted outrage by using a German concentration camp as the setting for a grim comedy, with farcical overtones. This time, Mr. Giannini played Pasqualino Farfuso, a craven Neapolitan deserter and two-bit charmer who, determined to survive at all costs, seduces the camp’s sadistic female commandant and, directed by her, murders other prisoners. Critics were divided over the merits of the film, but it earned Ms. Wertmüller the Oscar nomination. Not until 1994, when Jane Campion was nominated for “The Piano,” would another woman be nominated for directing. Ms. Wertmüller’s reputation, always more elevated in the United States than in Europe, remained uncertain. With “Seven Beauties,” the critic John Simon wrote, she ascended “into the highest regions of cinematic art, into the company of the major directors.” The critic David Thomson, on the other hand, ascribed her American popularity in the 1970s as “probably inevitable in a country ravenous for a female purveyor of smart cultural artifacts.” And her brand of sexual politics encountered hostility from critics like Pauline Kael, Molly Haskell and Ellen Willis, who called Ms. Wertmüller “a woman-hater who pretends to be a feminist.” Tiny and voluble, with a fierce smile and instantly recognizable white-framed eyeglasses, Ms. Wertmüller disarmed criticism by unleashing verbal torrents of explanation in a gravelly alto. Vincent Canby, after listening to her hold forth during a publicity tour for her first English-language film, “The End of the World in Our Usual Bed on a Night Full of Rain” (1978), wrote in The New York Times that she spoke “with enthusiasm and at such length and so articulately that (to vary an old Hollywood joke) it seems Warner Brothers might do better to scrap the film and distribute the director.” Arcangela Felice Assunta Wertmüller von Elgg Spañol von Braueich was born in Rome on Aug. 14, 1928, to a family of noble Swiss ancestry. Her mother was the former Maria Santamaria-Maurizio; her father, Federico, was a successful lawyer and a domestic tyrant with whom she quarreled constantly. After obtaining a teaching certificate, Ms. Wertmüller hedged her bets by enrolling simultaneously in law school and a Stanislavskian drama academy in Rome. Theater won out. During the 1950s, she toured with a puppet theater, wrote musical comedies for television and worked as an actress and stage manager. Her best friend, married to Marcello Mastroianni, introduced her to Federico Fellini, who hired her as an assistant director on “8½,” a life-changing experience that opened the world of film to her. In 1963 she directed her own film, “The Lizards,” a study of provincial life in the vein of Fellini’s “I Vitelloni.” It was followed by the quirky “Let’s Talk About Men” (1965), a study of sexual politics that foreshadowed her later explorations of the subject. Ms. Wertmüller’s long collaboration with Mr. Giannini began in television, when she directed him in the musical “Rita the Mosquito” (1966) and its sequel “Don’t Sting the Mosquito” (1967), whose art director, Enrico Job, she married in 1968. Mr. Job died in 2008. Ms. Wertmüller adopted Maria Zulima Job, her husband’s child with another woman, shortly after Ms. Job’s birth in 1991. Her daughter survives her. The 1970s presented Ms. Wertmüller with two of her richest subjects: the changing sexual politics brought about by feminism, and increasing political turbulence in Italy, as old social structures and attitudes buckled under the pressures of modernity. “The Seduction of Mimi,” chosen as an official entry at the Cannes festival in 1972, immediately established her as an important new filmmaker. “Love and Anarchy” (1973), with Mr. Giannini playing a bumbling country boy who tries to assassinate Mussolini, and the social satire “All Screwed Up” (1974) solidified her reputation for idiosyncratic political films blending tragedy and farce. Somewhat paradoxically, her career went into steep decline after the Academy nomination, although in 2019 she received an honorary Oscar for her work, and in 2016 she was the subject of a documentary, “Behind the White Glasses.” “The bubble seemed to burst,” the British critic Derek Malcolm told The Guardian, adding that “she could do nothing right.” The titles of the films grew even longer, and the critical response more uniformly hostile. “The End of the World,” with Candice Bergen as an American photographer and feminist engaged in marital struggle with an Italian communist played by Mr. Giannini, was roundly dismissed as raucous and incoherent. Each succeeding film seemed to bear out Michael Wood’s observation, in The New York Review of Books, that Ms. Wertmüller’s work displayed “a stunning visual intelligence accompanied by a great confusion of mind.” By the early 1990s she had qualified for inclusion in Variety’s “Missing Persons” column. “Ciao, Professore” (1994), about a schoolteacher from northern Italy mistakenly transferred to a poor school near Naples, suggested a return to form, but on a small scale, and with an unexpected sweetness. For perhaps the first time in her career, Ms. Wertmüller faced the charge of sentimentality. To this, as to all criticism, she responded by invoking the ultimate authority: herself. Her films, she liked to say, were made to please an audience of one, and her methods were intuitive. “I am sure of things only because I love them,” she said. “I am born first. Only then do I discover.” Advertisement"

Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Daniel Victor Al Unser Sr., one of only four drivers to win the Indianapolis 500 four times and a stalwart of one of auto racing’s most accomplished families, died on Thursday. He was 82. He died at his home in Chama, N.M., the Indianapolis Motor Speedway said. He had cancer for the past 17 years. Unser’s four Indianapolis 500 wins came in 1970, 1971, 1978 and 1987. The final victory made him the oldest driver, at 47, to win the United States’ premier auto race. In all, more than a dozen members of the Unser family would work in auto racing, including all three of Unser’s brothers. His older brother Bobby, who himself won the Indianapolis 500 three times, called the 1987 race on TV for a national audience. Unser won that race competing against his son, Al Unser Jr., who finished fourth that year and would go on to become one of the world’s premier drivers, twice winning the Indianapolis 500. They shared the track several times, and the father assumed the nickname Big Al after his son, nicknamed Little Al, established himself in racing. At the Beatrice Indy Challenge in 1985, Unser pulled up next to his son toward the end of the race. They briefly looked directly at each other, gave each other a wave, and Unser pulled ahead and won the race, The A.P. reported. “I’ve really got mixed emotions,” the elder Unser said after the race. “I’d like to have seen Al win. Championships are hard to come by.” He added: “Still, I’m a racer and I have to race. I said yesterday, if he wins it, he’s going to have to earn it.” He beat his son for the season title by one point. Alfred Unser Sr. was born in Albuquerque in 1939. His father, Jerry Unser, who owned a gas station and was an occasional racer and car builder, set him and his brothers on the path to racing royalty. His brother Bobby said in 2009 that he and Al did not fight and were “the closest of friends.” Al Unser passed on his love of racing to his son, helping the younger Al with a kart he began racing when he was 9. Unser became at least the third member of the family to die this year. Bobby died in May at 87, and his son Bobby Unser Jr. died in June at 65. Al Unser first competed in the Indianapolis 500 in 1965, running the race 27 times, the third-most in history. He led for 644 laps over his career, which remains a record.  “His quiet and humble approach outside of the car, combined with his fierce competitive spirit and fearless talent behind the wheel, made Al a fan favorite,” J. Douglas Boles, president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, said in a statement. Unser’s four wins at the Indianapolis 500 is a record shared by A.J. Foyt, Rick Mears and Helio Castroneves, who won this year’s race. Unser retired in 1994 and lived in Albuquerque. He is survived by his wife, Susan, and son, Al Unser Jr. Two daughters, Mary and Deborah, died before him. Advertisement"

Agent Sentenced to 12 Years in Drug Money Scheme - The New York Times,12/10/2021,"Advertisement Supported by Jose Ismael Irizarry took part in a seven-year scheme that used proceeds from drug investigations to buy jewelry, cars and a house in Colombia, prosecutors said. Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Michael Levenson A former special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration was sentenced to more than 12 years in prison on Thursday after he pleaded guilty to taking part in a wide-ranging conspiracy that used cash seized in undercover drug operations to buy jewelry, cars and a house in Colombia, prosecutors said. The former agent, Jose Ismael Irizarry, 47, and his wife, Nathalia Gomez-Irizarry, pleaded guilty in September to charges that they carried out a seven-year scheme to funnel more than $9 million from undercover drug investigations into bank accounts that they and their co-conspirators controlled. One of those co-conspirators was the leader of a Colombian drug-trafficking organization who became godfather to Mr. Irizarry’s children, according to federal prosecutors in Tampa, Fla. Mr. Irizarry pleaded guilty to charges that included conspiracy to launder monetary instruments, honest services wire fraud, bank fraud, and conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Ms. Gomez-Irizarry pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder monetary instruments. She was sentenced in December 2020 to 60 months of probation and ordered to forfeit a Tiffany diamond ring, according to the U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General. Mr. Irizarry, who had worked for the D.E.A. in Miami, Cartagena, Colombia, and Washington before he resigned in 2018, was arrested in February 2020 along with Ms. Gomez-Irizarry near their home in San Juan, P.R. In a 19-count indictment, Mr. Irizarry was accused of engaging in a “corrupt scheme” while he was assigned to investigate money laundering by drug-trafficking organizations. The indictment accused Mr. Irizarry of “enriching himself by secretly using his position and his special access to information to divert drug proceeds from D.E.A. control to the control of himself and his co-conspirators.” One co-conspirator was identified in the indictment as a public official in Colombia, who prosecutors said had used drug money to buy a $329,000 Lamborghini Huracán Spyder from a Miami car dealership. Mr. Irizarry was accused of using drug money to buy a Land Rover and a home in Cartagena. Prosecutors said that Mr. Irizarry had admitted that he began exploiting his position as a federal agent to enrich himself and his co-conspirators soon after he filed for bankruptcy in 2010. The indictment described a sprawling scheme in which Mr. Irizarry filed false reports on investigations, prompting a ripple effect that caused his colleagues at the Drug Enforcement Administration to falsely document the details of wire transfers, unwittingly concealing the source of drug profits that he controlled. Ms. Gomez-Irizarry was accused of running a shell company out of the couple’s home in Miramar, Fla., that had no employees and sold no goods but was used to take in and distribute the money her husband collected, the indictment said. “Former Special Agent Irizarry abused the trust of the American people when he repeatedly violated his oath as a federal law enforcement officer,” Anne Milgram, the D.E.A. administrator, said in a statement on Thursday. “Bringing him to justice reflects the principles of those who faithfully serve and uphold the values of D.E.A.” At his sentencing in federal court in Tampa, Mr. Irizarry wept and said that his biggest punishment was not being able to explain to his two young daughters why he would be gone for so long, The Associated Press reported. He said he had been proud when he became a federal agent two decades ago. “Unfortunately, there came a time when I made a decision that went against the person who I was, that damaged my wife and embarrassed my country,” Mr. Irizarry said, according to The A.P. “I should’ve known better and I didn’t. I failed.” Mr. Irizarry’s sentencing came after another former special agent with the D.E.A., Chad Allan Scott, was sentenced in August to more than 13 years in prison after he perjured himself and directed others to commit perjury to obtain a conviction against an accused drug dealer, prosecutors said. Mr. Scott also falsified forms so that he could take possession of a truck that a drug dealer bought for him, prosecutors said. Mr. Irizarry’s lawyer, Maria A. Dominguez, blamed the culture at the D.E.A. for encouraging such crimes. “Jose was not a leader or the author of this conduct,” she said in an interview on Thursday. “It was conduct that he encountered when he first joined the D.E.A. He was corrupted in that sort of environment, which disrupted his moral compass.” While sentencing Mr. Irizarry, Judge Charlene Honeywell condemned the D.E.A. for its failings and said other agents corrupted by “the allure of easy money” should be investigated, The A.P. reported. “This has to stop,” Judge Honeywell said, according to The A.P. “You were the one who got caught, but it is apparent to this court that there are others.” Advertisement"

Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Tara Parker-Pope What good things did you do for yourself in 2021? This year on Well, we suggested a number of small habits that can make life just a little better. It’s not too late to try them, and pick a few you’d like to continue. Here are eight of our favorites. Give the best hours of your day to yourself. What time of day do you feel your best? For some people, we may feel most energetic during the first few hours of the morning. For night owls, evening might be our best time of day. Now ask yourself, “Who gets those hours?” Do you spend your best hours checking emails, catching up on work or doing tasks for your family? Try giving that time to yourself instead. Use it to focus on your priorities, rather than someone else’s. You can use that hour or two for anything you want — it might be for a hobby, a project that you feel passionate about, time with your children or even to volunteer and help others. Setting aside your best hours to focus on personal goals and values is the ultimate form of self-care. Enjoy exercise snacks. Too often we think of exercise as a formal activity we have to do for an hour at the gym each day. But a number of studies show that short bursts of exercise several times a day lead to meaningful gains in fitness and overall health. Just as you might grab a handful of chips or nuts to break the monotony of your day, an exercise “snack” is a quick movement break. Get up and pace when you’re on the phone. Do jumping jacks, lunges, a wall sit or walk the stairs for 20 seconds. My go-to exercise snack is 10 wall push-ups. Take a gratitude photo. If a gratitude journal isn’t your thing, make a plan to take one photo a day of something special in your life. It can be a cute picture of your dog, a sunset or a delicious meal. Take a moment to study the photo, sit with your feelings of gratitude, and then share it with a friend or post it on social media. When we make an effort to notice our surroundings or show appreciation for the people, places or things that make us happy, it’s called “savoring.” Scientists know that savoring exercises can lead to meaningful gains in overall happiness and well-being. Print a “feelings” list. Every day when you brush your teeth or make your coffee, ask yourself: How are you, really? Think of a word that describes exactly what you’re feeling. Unsettled? Energetic? Delighted? Frazzled? (Avoid standard answers like “good,” “fine” or “OK.”) This simple labeling activity is surprisingly effective for calming stress and taking the sting out of negative thoughts. Studies show that when we label our feelings, it helps turn off the emotional alarm system in our brain and lowers our stress response. Click the link for a list of words, from the Hoffman Institute, to describe how you’re feeling and put it on your refrigerator or your bathroom. Ask your kids to pick a word from the list every day too. It can be a surprisingly fun family routine. Do a five-finger meditation. This is an easy way to calm yourself, no matter where you are. Use the index finger of one hand to trace the outline of the opposite hand. As you trace up a finger, breathe in. As you trace down, breathe out. Continue finger by finger until you’ve traced your entire hand. Now reverse directions and do it again, making sure to inhale as you trace up, and exhale as you trace down. (Click on the link for a simple animation showing how it’s done.) I’ve used this method on airplanes, before getting my Covid vaccine shots and during stressful meetings, and it works every time. Make it easy: In the scientific study of habit formation, the thing that makes it harder for you to achieve your goal is called friction, which typically comes in three forms — distance, time and effort. The friction-free habits you’ll keep are those that are convenient, happen close to home and don’t take much time or effort. For example, one of my goals this year was to cook more and stop ordering take out or buying expensive grocery-prepared foods. I hated going to the grocery store, and I found it difficult to cook for one person. Then I read a Wirecutter article on the best meal kit delivery services and realized I could make home cooking a lot easier on myself. I started using the Martha Stewart & Marley Spoon meal kits, and it was like having my own personal sous chef. By removing the friction, cooking is now fun, easy and delicious. Watch the jellyfish. One of the best mindfulness tips I came across this year was from Cord Jefferson, the television writer who thanked his therapist on national television when he won an Emmy Award. Mr. Jefferson told me he struggled with traditional meditation, but he enjoys watching the feed from a web camera showing the jellyfish at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Bookmark the jelly-cam on your phone or laptop browser and get lost in the gentle pulses of the jellyfish for a short mindfulness break during your workday. Find a health buddy. Choose a friend who shares your health goals and make a plan. Meet each other once or twice a week for a walking date. Or it could be a daily text check-in to see how you’re doing on a diet, or a Zoom call to work together on a decluttering project. Studies show we’re more likely to reach our goals when we bring a friend along for the journey. More from the Well newsletter Prolonged grief disorder is a syndrome in which people feel stuck in an endless cycle of mourning that can last for years or even decades, severely impairing their daily life, relationships and job performance. The disorder was recently added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Symptoms of P.G.D. can include emotional numbness; intense loneliness; avoidance of reminders the person is not there; feeling that life is meaningless; difficulty with reintegration into life; extreme emotional pain, sorrow or anger; a sense of disbelief about the death; and a feeling that a part of oneself has died. In the immediate aftermath, or “acute” phase of a death, such feelings are considered normal. But when three or more of these symptoms persist nearly every day for a year after the loss in adults, or for six months in children and adolescents, grief counselors say it can be a worrisome sign of prolonged grief disorder. The disorder, which was previously known as complicated grief and persistent complex bereavement disorder, isn’t new. But before it was listed in the D.S.M. as a condition for further study. Preliminary studies suggest that it affects around 7 percent of those in mourning, though estimates vary. With the coronavirus claiming nearly 800,000 lives so far in the United States alone, grief counselors are concerned about the ongoing fallout. Each Covid death is projected to leave a ring of nine bereaved: That’s roughly seven million grieving parents, children, siblings, grandparents and spouses. And the losses cast a shadow over many more.

You can become stronger and ready for the next challenge. Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Emily Sohn Maimuna Majumder felt as prepared as a person could be when the Covid-19 pandemic began in early 2020. As an infectious disease epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital, she had been studying emerging pandemics for a decade. But this one was personal. She lost colleagues to Covid-19 and suicide during the pandemic. Her uncle spent time in an intensive care unit in Bangladesh. During long work days, she forgot to eat for 14 hours at a time. All the while, Dr. Majumder, a Muslim woman of color who communicates publicly about the pandemic, faced attacks and threats on social media. To avoid crumbling from the stress, she focused on her work. She turned to group chats with like-minded people for social support. She dedicated at least 15 minutes a day to taking care of herself with creative pursuits, like painting. And she embraced the development of deep bonds to the people she works with. All of those steps, she said, helped preserve her well-being. “We’ve all gone through this really traumatic experience together responding to this pandemic, but having been through that together has been a really unifying experience,” she said. “That’s something that I am very grateful for.” Mental health has become its own pandemic during the pandemic, with soaring rates of anxiety, depression and burnout. But some studies show that a substantial portion of adults have found ways to function and even thrive, in spite of dealing with the global health crisis and societal upheaval. This trend illustrates the human potential for what psychologists call resilience, the ability to bounce back from negative experiences and endure adversity. As with any crisis, some people have even become stronger than they were before the pandemic — with positive changes in how they view themselves, their feelings about life or their relationships. Psychologists call this reaction post-traumatic growth. The good news is both resilience and the ability to grow from adversity can be cultivated, whether during the best of times or in the middle of a crisis. Studies suggest a number of strategies — like seeking social support, cultivating a positive outlook and interrupting stress — can set you up to stay strong, or even get stronger, in tough times. “Resilience is a set of skills that one develops,” said Dr. Steven Southwick, a psychiatrist with a specialty in post-traumatic stress at the Yale School of Medicine. “And virtually anyone can learn to be more resilient.” A week after Canada implemented Covid-19 lockdowns in March 2020, Simon Coulombe, an industrial relations and psychology researcher at Laval University, in Quebec, and Tyler Pacheco, a psychology Ph.D. student at Wilfrid Laurier University, in Waterloo, started surveying more than 1,000 Canadian adults about their well-being. They did the same a couple of weeks after that, and again two months after the pandemic began. Participants reported plenty of stress from job insecurity or fear of the virus, and for many these stresses were linked with the feeling that life had lost some of its meaning. But social support and social interaction turned out to protect people from some of that stress. Even in the first few weeks, according to data the researchers haven’t yet published, nearly half said they had experienced markers of post-traumatic growth — such as a sense that they had helped others — and a big reason for that was family and friend networks. That trend persisted for months, Dr. Coulombe said. Some people are likely born more resilient than others, he added, but there is plenty of wiggle room to shore yourself up, and building social support is one of the biggest protective factors, according to decades of studies. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, surveys found, up to 70 percent of people said they felt depressed. But 60 percent also reported that their relationships felt stronger, along with feelings of affection for loved ones. Based on a study of several dozen college students at the time, researchers concluded that gratitude, love and other positive emotions in the weeks after the event, even amid trouble sleeping and concentrating, provided a crucial buffer against depression. To cultivate positivity, the researchers recommended seeking comfort in spiritual or religious beliefs, doing enjoyable activities and talking about the best of times — in therapy, if needed. Humor, relaxation and optimistic thinking can all help evoke positivity and facilitate coping in the midst of tough times, according to studies dating back to the 1990s. In our pandemic era, that might mean settling in with friends or family for a beloved comedy show. Even if optimism doesn’t come naturally to you, it’s a skill you can nurture, said George Everly Jr., a psychologist and public health expert at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who has done research with dialysis patients and war veterans. “There is neuroscience research indicating that even if you were born a pessimist, you can become an optimist,” he said. “We must come from this and say: What are the lessons learned?” Looking on the bright side can help people make sense of what’s happening, Dr. Coulombe said. “The pandemic was so disruptive, some people used that disruption as a way to do a fresh start.” This urge to make significant life changes struck Audrey Anderson, 30, who was coordinating cancer research trials at Stony Brook University in New York when the pandemic began. Quickly, she got reassigned to a trial testing plasma as a treatment for Covid-19 — getting paperwork from patients, delivering plasma to clinicians and doing whatever else was needed. As part of her job, she also sat with cancer patients who were suddenly no longer allowed to have visitors to the hospital, keeping them company and answering questions about their treatment and Covid-19. Working 80 hours a week, Ms. Anderson saw people get extremely sick and depressed, and some died. But she found strength in helping, echoing studies that find helping others can breed resilience and post-traumatic growth. And that positive outlook helped her start something new. Ms. Anderson is now halfway through an accelerated nursing program at Stony Brook. “Once you see stuff like that, it changes you,” she said. “It makes you respect life more. It makes you not want to take things for granted.” Reducing the stress you feel in response to traumatic events can be psychologically protective, said Dr. Southwick, whose research includes work with Special Forces instructors and people who have survived natural disasters. In the brain, he said, chronic stress can increase the volume of some regions at the expense of others, potentially reducing our ability to regulate our emotions, among other effects. But techniques such as mindfulness and breathing exercises (slow, deep breaths or extended exhalations) activate brain regions responsible for attention, emotions and self-awareness. Those changes, in turn, can interrupt the progression from fear to anxiety and help facilitate healing. It’s worth taking steps now to protect your mental health for the future, experts say. In a 2019 review study, researchers reported that programs aimed at helping cancer patients cope with stress and find meaning in their experiences led to better mental health and higher quality of life. And the skills you learn from thriving after trauma can lead to what researchers call an “upward spiral” of positive outcomes after future tragedies. Veterans who experience post-traumatic growth after trauma become less likely to develop P.T.S.D. after another trauma, according to research by Dr. Southwick and colleagues. Nobody should feel bad about feeling low, Dr. Southwick said. Extreme distress is a prerequisite for post-traumatic growth, and it can take months or years for that growth to happen. Stress and coping often occur at the same time. But a dramatic shake-up in your life can set you up to reassess what matters, and that can be good. “We see it in people who have survived bereavement, natural disasters, vehicle accidents, medical conditions,” and among combat veterans and people working in the medical field, Dr. Southwick said. “They might find themselves thinking: I’m more vulnerable than I thought. But I’m stronger than I ever imagined.” Emily Sohn is freelance journalist in Minneapolis. Advertisement"

The 7-Day Well Challenge will show you how. Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Tara Parker-Pope Whether your goal for the new year is to lose weight, start exercising or focus on self-care, ask yourself: How can I make this easier? In the scientific study of habit formation, the thing that makes it harder for you to achieve your goal is called friction. Reducing friction means removing an obstacle or coming up with a strategy that makes a task easier to do. And if you figure out how to make a goal easier, you’re more likely to succeed. Friction typically comes in three forms — distance, time and effort. For instance, living far from the gym or a favorite walking trail makes it less likely that you’ll go. (One study found that people who lived 5.1 miles from the gym went only once a month, but those who lived within 3.7 miles went five times a month or more.) Time constraints can also get in the way of new healthy habits. If you don’t have much free time, it’s harder to start meditating or working out. And if something requires a lot of effort — like healthful cooking in a disorganized kitchen — you’re less likely to do it. Sometimes adding friction to your life helps you achieve a goal. In one study, slowing down elevator doors by 26 seconds prompted more people to take the stairs. Removing vending machines from schools makes it harder for teens to snack on junk food or drink sugary soda. “The friction you set up or remove in the environment is going to have an effect long after you’ve gotten discouraged and are less excited about the new behavior,” said Wendy Wood, a research psychologist at the University of Southern California and author of “Good Habits, Bad Habits.” “That’s why friction is so powerful. It persists.” Pandemic life has altered many of our routines — so friction that used to be there may have disappeared, and new challenges may have added new friction. For instance, some people no longer commute to work, giving them more time to do other things. While online schooling has made life tough on many parents, families also may have fewer extracurricular obligations, making it easier to have dinner at home. To identify the friction that may be stopping you from achieving your goals, take a moment to think about the time, distance and effort the goal requires. “Ask yourself, ‘What would make it easier for me to do this?’” said Dr. Wood. “You want to reduce the effort. The thing about friction is we often don’t focus on it when we’re changing our behavior. We focus on ourselves and keeping ourselves motivated and exerting willpower. But you have to recognize that you’re also going to be influenced by the things going on around you.” For today’s final Well Challenge, try to make a new habit a little easier with these friction-busting ideas. Day 7 Everybody has different goals for better health. Here are several different ways you can create a new health habit with less effort. Choose one or several to try or come up with your own easy health resolution. Sleep in your workout clothes. If you’re trying to start a morning exercise routine, make it easy to get dressed for a morning run or workout. Sleep in some or all of your workout clothes. Put your shoes and socks by the bed. It’s one less obstacle to slow you down in the morning. Put hand weights by your desk. Keep light hand weights nearby and do some reps while you’re on a conference call. Hang hooks by your door. Whether you’re always losing your keys or forgetting your mask, creating a station of hooks or shelves by the door for masks, keys or any other essentials you need when you leave the house will help you make mask-wearing a habit. Put extra masks in your coat pockets. I bought a pack of disposable masks and always have a half-dozen stuffed in the pockets of my coats. You never know when you might drop a mask on the ground, decide you want to double mask or offer a mask to someone in need. Over the summer my daughter rode a bike to meet me for an outdoor dinner and her mask blew away. She knew I’d have a replacement handy. Stand on one leg while brushing your teeth. Standing on one leg while brushing your teeth is a way to practice balance. (Change legs after a minute of brushing.) Or use tooth-brushing time to practice mindfulness. You can find a tooth-brushing meditation here. When you add a new habit (like meditation or a balance exercise) to an old habit (like brushing your teeth) it’s called “stacking.” Stacking your habits makes them easier to remember. Buy kitchen tongs. You’ll be amazed how much easier it is to cook, toss a salad or serve noodles with the right set of tongs. In general, having the right gadgets for your kitchen is a way to make cooking easier, and easy is good. Read “These Are the Only Kitchen Tools You’ll Need,” from Julia Moskin, or check out Wirecutter’s advice for the best kitchen tools. Organize your refrigerator. Often the tipping point in a kitchen is the refrigerator. When your fridge is a mess, it’s hard to know what you have available to cook, what food might spoil soon and what you need from the store. Wirecutter has the best fridge organization advice from Marguerite Preston, a former pastry chef, who knows how professional chefs organize a kitchen. “In restaurants, organization is important not only because it helps cooks move quickly and smoothly, but also because wasted food is wasted money,” she writes. “The same is true at home. You may not see the effects of a chaotic fridge in a bad Yelp review or a balance sheet, but they will show in the time it takes to cook dinner and the stress involved.” Watch the jellyfish. One of the best mindfulness tips I came across this year was from Cord Jefferson, the television writer who thanked his therapist on national television when he won an Emmy. Mr. Jefferson told me he struggled with traditional meditation, but he enjoys watching the feed from a web camera showing the jellyfish at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Bookmark the jelly-cam on your phone or laptop browser and get lost in the jellyfish for a short mindfulness break during your workday. Do the Standing 7-Minute Workout. All you need is a wall and a chair nearby for balance. You don’t even have to change your clothes. Our new workout video is a friction-busting workout for anyone who avoids exercise because it’s hard to get up from the floor after a push-up, plank or situps. Complete a 1-minute task. One of my favorite health tips for dealing with stress is the one-minute rule. It comes from Gretchen Rubin, author of “Better Than Before,” a book about forming new habits. This simple advice helps you decide what to tackle on a long to-do list. Just do the one-minute tasks first. Hang up a coat. Read some emails. Clear and wipe the kitchen counter. Tidy a book shelf. Whenever you take on a one-minute task, you’ll get a sense of accomplishment and quick boost of happiness. Do a five-finger meditation. This is an easy way to calm yourself, no matter where you are. (I tried it in a dentist chair, and it worked for me!) Start by holding your hand in front of you, fingers spread. Using your index finger on the other hand, start tracing the outline of your hand. Trace up your pinkie, and down. Trace up your ring finger and down. As you do this, breathe in as you trace up, and out as you trace down. Continue finger by finger until you’ve traced your entire hand. Now reverse the process and trace from your thumb back to your pinkie, making sure to inhale as you trace up, and exhale as you trace down. You can find more tips for beating stress in my story, “Peak Anxiety? Here Are 10 Ways to Calm Down.” Create a Sunday basket. I learned this tip from Lisa Woodruff, author of “The Paper Solution.” She suggests dumping your bills, receipts and various papers into a basket. (She sells a product for this, but I just use a regular basket.) Once a week, sort your actionable papers (those that need attention) from your archive papers (those that can be filed.) The Sunday basket approach (she claims it will add five extra hours to your week) is part of a larger system proposed by Ms. Woodruff that uses three-ring binders rather than a filing cabinet. (She suggests five binders for financial information, medical needs, household reference, school items and daily operations.) For me, the Sunday basket is enough, but if you feel chronically overwhelmed by paper, you can learn more on the Organize365.com website. Buy partially prepared food. Buying chopped up food and meal kits costs more, but it does save time. “I always used to avoid buying cut fruits and vegetables in the grocery store, but I found I actually use them sooner, so in the end it kind of pays off,” said Dr. Wood. Keep a tip jar. Tipping in person (rather than by credit card) is an easy way to add a gratitude practice to a delivery day. Pandemic life has meant a lot more deliveries to my door, but I never had cash, so I usually just added the tip to the card. I decided to create the tip jar and make an effort to tip in cash. What I didn’t anticipate is that I would get so much more enjoyment out of tipping in person. (I always wash my hands first, wear a mask at the door and keep it brief.) Put a notebook and pen by your bed. Keeping pen and paper by your bedside allows you to do a nightly stress-dump of all the things on your mind that might otherwise keep you up at night. You get a head start on tomorrow by creating a to-do list. And you can end your day with a simple gratitude practice — writing down three things for which you are grateful. Create a device charging station outside your bedroom. The blue light in your screen has the same effect on your brain as sunlight, which means it wakes you up just when you want to be drifting off. If you’re trying to cut back on screens at bedtime, add some friction by setting up a charging station in your work area, the kitchen — anywhere but your bedroom. “If it’s in the bedroom, it’s easier to use,” said Dr. Wood. “That’s part of the temptation of always staying online. Keep devices out of the bedroom.” Advertisement"

Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Tara Parker-Pope If you want to make positive changes in your life, try building on a lesson many of us learned in 2020: Hold yourself accountable. The notion of accountability — to yourself and to others — has been an important part of pandemic living. To avoid spreading the virus, we’ve needed to be accountable for wearing a mask, limiting our contacts and keeping our distance. But accountability can also help you achieve your health goals. Gretchen Rubin, author of “Better Than Before,” a book about forming healthy habits, says that accountability is an important tool for making and breaking habits. Accountability works best when it comes from the outside. You can create accountability by checking in with a friend every day to talk about healthful eating. You’re more likely to exercise if you’ve made a plan to walk with a friend or scheduled a workout with a personal trainer. You can create public accountability by declaring your intention on social media. If you prefer to stay accountable only to yourself, you can create accountability by using an app that sends you daily reminders or by wearing a Fitbit or smart watch to track your exercise habits. You can even hold yourself accountable through a daily journal entry. “We do better when someone’s watching,” Ms. Rubin said. “Even when we’re the ones doing the watching!” A 2018 North Carolina State University study of 704 people enrolled in a 15-week online weight-loss program found that participants with buddies lost more weight and waist inches than those who took the course without buddy support. So for today’s Well challenge, think about a health goal you want to achieve and focus on how you can hold yourself accountable. I’ve included a few suggestions for how to do it. Sign up for the Well newsletter to get the 7-Day Well Challenge in your inbox. Day 6 What is your goal for 2021? Do you want to improve your eating habits, lose weight or exercise more? Or maybe you just want to finish that screenplay you’ve been working on? You’re more likely to succeed if you get some help. Find an accountability buddy. Choose a friend who wants to achieve a similar goal and make a plan. Accountability might mean meeting each other once or twice a week for a walking date. Or it could be a daily text check-in to see how you’re doing on a diet or a Zoom call to work on a decluttering project together. “Some people are very accountable to themselves, but not most people,” said Dr. Tim Church, a well-known exercise and obesity expert and chief medical officer for Naturally Slim, an app-based behavioral health program in Dallas. “In my years of working with thousands of people, there’s one thing that drives accountability more than anything else: If you want to keep people doing a behavior, get a buddy.” While the presence of an accountability buddy adds some gentle peer pressure, the key is to focus on the behavior, not success or failure. For instance, if a person is trying to lose weight, don’t focus on the scale. Instead, check in and remind them to log what they ate, encourage them to eat more fruits and vegetables and remind them of the benefits of a regular weigh-in (but you don’t need to ask them the result). If they’re beating themselves up for eating two desserts, talk about what might have triggered an emotional eating binge. “An accountability partner is there to support you, to problem-solve and to celebrate even the small victories,” Dr. Church said. “Judgment is the quickest way to destroy all that. People are so hard on themselves. You don’t need to be hard on them.” Use an app. An app is a great way to add accountability to your day. Meditation apps like Headspace and Calm will send daily reminders and track your progress. The weight-loss app Noom asks you to check in for a few minutes each day, complete mini-health courses and track what you’ve eaten. The Fitbit app counts your steps, will sync with your smart scale and vibrates to remind you to get up and move. Set reminders. Once you set a health goal, hold yourself accountable by creating calendar reminders to help you achieve it. Schedule walk breaks or daily or weekly check-ins with your accountability buddy. Declare it on social media. Telling your friends on social media that you’re cutting back on packaged foods, or sending a tweet every time you finish a class on your exercise bike creates virtual accountability. Commit to posting on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or another platform every time you complete a goal, or share your feelings on days you’re struggling. When you declare your goals on social media, you’re likely to find a like-minded friend who will want to join your journey and offer words of support. Advertisement"

Anyone can read what you share. By Zachary Woolfe It was deep into Julie Taymor’s playful production of Mozart’s “The Magic Flute” at the Metropolitan Opera. Darkness had fallen onstage; the hero, Prince Tamino, and Papageno, the cheeky bird catcher, were lost. “Papageno,” Matthew Polenzani, who sings Tamino in the abridged, English-language, family-friendly “Flute” that opens the holiday season at the Met on Friday, called out at a recent rehearsal. “Are you still with me?” As he rotated past on a set piece, the tenor Rolando Villazón, wearing Papageno’s lime-green long johns and backward baseball cap, answered in accented English, “I’m right here.” Coming from Villazón, there was a note of defiance in saying that on the Met’s mighty stage. Though he was once one of the company’s brightest young stars, Friday marks his first performance there in eight years. Many — him included — assumed he would never appear at the Met again. “We can call it a roller coaster,” Villazón, 49, said in an interview. “A very bumpy career.” Plagued for much of the past 15 years by vocal problems and mental fears, Villazón lost his consistency and his nerve. “Everything fell apart for him,” said Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager. “At least at the Met. He had some vocal setbacks and disappeared from our radar.” Villazón had reconciled himself to the end of his career, but during the pandemic he stumbled across a new approach to singing — and now believes he isn’t yet finished. Returning to the Met as Papageno, a role almost always sung by a lower voice, might still appear to be an admission of weakness: a tenor losing his high notes and scrambling to the safety of baritone territory. Not so fast. “I’m not a baritone,” Villazón said, noting that Mozart wrote the part for Emanuel Schikaneder, the “Flute” librettist, who was a famed actor and impresario but far from a traditional opera singer. “There are some low notes that aren’t really for a tenor, like B flat. But they’re mostly in the harmony. The lowest when he sings alone is a C, which is very central.” It’s true, though: When Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the Met’s music director, asked him to sing Papageno for a recording in 2018, Villazón at first demurred. “I mean, in terms of the character, I love the character,” he said, “But, of course, baritone role, ta ta ta. …” In other words, people might take his casting as an admission that the voice that had brought him celebrity was in permanent retreat. It was a fear he soon got over. “To be honest,” he said, “it’s been a long time since I am worried about what people think.” This is still a course few would have predicted when he rose, in the early 2000s, as a lyric tenor, boyish and ardent in “La Bohème,” “Rigoletto,” “La Traviata” and “L’Elisir d’Amore” — even if there was always a duskiness to his tone, allowing him to be convincing in, for example, the heavier title role of Offenbach’s “Les Contes d’Hoffmann.” A 2005 profile in The New York Times observed that Villazón was being compared to Plácido Domingo, at whose Operalia competition Villazón got his big break in 1999. “The voice, at this early stage,” the Times profile said, “weighs in on the light side but is tinged like Mr. Domingo’s with the dark shading of a baritone.” From Lil Nas X to Mozart to Esperanza Spalding here is what we loved listening to this year. That summer, Villazón and Anna Netrebko, also fast-rising at the time, created a sensation in Willy Decker’s spare, vivid staging of “La Traviata” at the Salzburg Festival in Austria, and were swiftly anointed opera’s next onstage power couple. “He seemed,” Gelb said, “to be the most exciting tenor in 2005, ’06.” In 2007, Villazón and Netrebko were the stars of a gala celebration of the Met’s 40th anniversary at Lincoln Center. But while Netrebko’s career continued to skyrocket, calamity struck Villazón: He began to crack on some high notes, a tenor’s lifeblood. Cancellations piled up, including a Live in HD broadcast of “Lucia di Lammermoor” from the Met alongside Netrebko. A cyst was eventually discovered inside his vocal cords; after a delicate operation in 2009, he couldn’t speak for some time, let alone sing. He gingerly re-emerged on opera and concert stages, including a Met run of “Eugene Onegin” in 2013. (“Despite some initial cautiousness in the first act, in which he sometimes sounded underpowered,” the Times review said, “he sang with confidence and poise.”) “It was for me very important to reestablish myself, to reposition as a tenor,” Villazón said. But the long period of uncertainty and tweaks to his technique had left their mark, and he began to lose confidence in himself and his instrument. “Around 2015, 2016, that’s when I started to develop stage fright, because I was afraid of getting something else,” he said. “I was hitting nine out of 10 high notes. When you are in this business, and at this level, you hit 10 out of 10. They might not be all beautiful, but you hit all of them. If you’re not hitting one of those 10, you start thinking, Is this the one? And then you start hitting eight out of 10, and seven out of 10.” He worked with sports coaches, and tried taking a small amount of anti-anxiety medication before performances. That helped with his fear, but took away the internal fire that he felt fueled his best work. “How do I stop it being hell to go on and perform?” he recalled thinking. He re-embraced the Baroque repertory that he had done earlier in his career under the conductor Emmanuelle Haïm, moving away from the high notes that had turned perilously unreliable. Then he developed what he called “uncomfortable sensations,” even in the middle of his voice. In 2017, 10 years after headlining the Met’s 40th-anniversary gala, Villazón dropped out a few days before his appearance at its 50th. He felt basically done: “I thought, Let me reach 50 and I can call it quits as a singer.” It helped that singing wasn’t all he was doing by that point. He had some success as a television personality, was directing productions and had been named the artistic leader of the Mozartwoche festival in Salzburg. He had even started writing novels. But he wasn’t yet ready to give up performing entirely, and discovered that acid reflux was causing his new round of problems. He had another operation, at the end of 2018, and slowly his vocal steadiness, though not his high notes, came back. Then, practicing during the pandemic, he hit a note — an F — and immediately knew something had shifted in the way he produced sound. Working with coaches, he revised his approach to his voice; even some of his older, higher-flying roles felt possible again. “The way it feels, I’m entering the greatest moment of my career,” he said. “I have no ambitions. I don’t need to achieve, professionally, anything else. It’s all artistic achievements.” So his coming seasons will include Mozart’s Tito and Idomeneo; Edgardo in “Lucia”; even Loge, the trickster fire god in Wagner’s “Das Rheingold,” which Villazón was working on when he had his pandemic breakthrough. “I certainly plan to sit with him and discuss other roles with him,” Gelb said. “I don’t want this to be a drive-by appearance. But it’s up to him, and what he feels comfortable with.” Papageno, then, is hopefully not the beginning of the end for Villazón, but a delightful lark — a part for which he doesn’t feel the need to apologize, and on which he can lavish his fascination with the figure of the clown. “They never lose, they never die, and they never quit,” he said. “The clown goes on.” Advertisement"

Week 14 Predictions: Our Picks Against the Spread - The New York Times,12/9/2021,"Advertisement Supported by The Buccaneers will presumably throw the ball against the Bills, and Dallas and Washington will jangle the N.F.C. East order. Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Emmanuel Morgan Our N.F.L. playoffs calculator has an up-to-date look at the latest playoff picture. So much for the supposed parity in the N.F.L. this season. Amid a back-and-forth season, the predictable has happened: The revitalized New England Patriots (9-4) are atop the A.F.C., just as they’ve been for the better part of the last two decades, and Kansas City, which has won the past two conference titles, is not far behind. Teams should begin determining their postseason fates with this week’s slate of games, starting Thursday with a matchup between teams that dramatically changed their trajectories in Week 13: the Pittsburgh Steelers, who had been left for dead, and the Minnesota Vikings, who suffered a bizarre loss that narrowed their playoff window. In two divisional games Sunday, the Dallas Cowboys and Washington Football Team will be jockeying in the top-heavy N.F.C., as the Cleveland Browns try to prevent the Baltimore Ravens from gaining ground on the Patriots (who have a bye). Then, the Arizona Cardinals and Los Angeles Rams, two of the five N.F.C. teams jostling for home-field advantage in the playoffs will headline Monday night’s matchup. Below is a look at N.F.L. Week 14, with all picks made against the spread. Byes: Colts, Dolphins, Eagles, Patriots All times are Eastern. Last Week’s record: 9-5 Buffalo Bills at Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 4:25 p.m., CBS Line: Buccaneers -3 | Total: 52 Expect the Bills (7-5) to play motivated. While it won’t be as cold as last week’s game in Western New York, Sunday’s forecasts call for windy and rainy weather in Tampa, Fla., where the Buccaneers (9-3) will certainly pass more than the Patriots did. Tom Brady leads the league in yards (3,771) and touchdowns (34), and should test the Bills’ top-ranked passing defense, which has allowed only 1,983 yards. Despite the absence of the top cornerback Tre’Davious White and potentially playing without linebacker A.J. Klein (Covid-19), Buffalo should get back on track, or at least keep the score close. Pick: Bills +3 Baltimore Ravens at Cleveland Browns, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Browns -2.5 | Total: 42.5 A bye last week should mean Baker Mayfield will return rested, if not completely healed, of the shoulder and foot injuries that diminished his recent performances. An emphasis on the passing attack for the Browns (6-6) could exploit the Ravens (8-4), who lost for the season their third member of the secondary, cornerback Marlon Humphrey (torn pectoral muscle). Lamar Jackson threw four interceptions against Cleveland two weeks ago, but the Ravens still won because the Browns wasted possessions and rushed for only 40 yards. If Baltimore’s front seven can again hinder the Browns’ running and play-action passing, the hallmarks of the offense, Mayfield will have fewer opportunities to play where he’s comfortable. Pick: Ravens +2.5 Dallas Cowboys at Washington Football Team, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Cowboys -4 | Total: 43 Washington (6-6) has slowly crept into the playoff conversation, with three N.F.C. East teams in as of Thursday morning. A win against the Cowboys (8-4) could further shake the division race as January approaches. Washington has won four consecutive games, a stretch in which Taylor Heinicke has completed over 70 percent of his passes. The Footballers’ defense has also not allowed more than 100 rushing yards in three of those four games. The Cowboys’ offense has underperformed in recent weeks largely because of questionable play-calling and a failure to run the ball well (Dallas had fewer than 100 rushing yards in two of the last three games). If they can revert to their prolific running in the first half of the season and if the defense, led by Micah Parsons and Trevon Diggs, continues to create turnovers, the Cowboys should win. Pick: Cowboys -4 Las Vegas Raiders at Kansas City, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Kansas City -9.5 | Total: 49 After thoroughly dispatching the Broncos, Kansas City (8-4) could increase its distance from the rest of the A.F.C. West by beating the Raiders (6-6), who currently have a 14 percent chance of reaching the postseason, according to the playoff predictor. Kansas City’s defense has improved after a slow start to the season and has held each of its last five opponents — including the Raiders in Week 10 — to under 20 points. Meanwhile, the offense seems to have adjusted to feasting on sure gains since opponents have limited Patrick Mahomes’s downfield strikes. Kansas City is clearly the better team and should easily dole Las Vegas its fifth loss in six games. Pick: Kansas City -9.5 San Francisco 49ers at Cincinnati Bengals, 4:25 p.m., Fox Line: 49ers -1 | Total: 47.5 Both the 49ers (6-6) and the Bengals (7-5) lost key games last week just as they were gaining momentum ahead of the playoffs. Cincinnati quarterback Joe Burrow dislocated the pinkie finger on his throwing hand against the Chargers, but played through the injury and should not miss any time. It’s unclear, though, how that will affect his performance going forward. For San Francisco, cornerback Emmanuel Moseley is questionable with a high ankle sprain and running back Elijah Mitchel is in the concussion protocol. It’s also unknown whether receiver Deebo Samuel (groin) and linebacker Fred Warner (hamstring), two of the team’s top four players, will return after missing last week. This game should be competitive, but the Bengals should win at home against a 49ers team contending with injuries. Pick: Bengals +1 Jacksonville Jaguars at Tennessee Titans, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Titans -10 | Total: 45.5 It seems like the Jaguars (2-10) are the league’s universal “get-right” opponent. A week after taking a beatdown from the Rams, Jacksonville must play the Titans (8-4), who lost back-to-back games before their bye. Tennessee designated receiver Julio Jones to return from injured reserve, which should help the team’s passing attack operate without A.J. Brown, who is still recovering from a chest injury. The Titans’ replacement cast of running backs has also shown it can operate respectfully while Derrick Henry rehabs his foot injury. Jacksonville’s recent performances offer no reason to think that taking the over makes sense. Pick: Titans -10 New Orleans Saints at Jets, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Saints -6 | Total: 43.5 Taysom Hill is expected to start again at quarterback for the Saints (5-7) and play through a finger injury. New Orleans is also hopeful to return running back Alvin Kamara, who has missed four games with a knee injury. If Hill can reduce his turnovers (he threw four interceptions against the Cowboys), the Saints should beat the Jets (3-9), who lost Corey Davis, the team’s second-leading receiver, to season-ending core muscle surgery. A loss to the Jets, though, would be unacceptable for New Orleans. Pick: Saints -6 Atlanta Falcons at Carolina Panthers, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Panthers -3 | Total: 43.5 After starting 3-0, the Panthers (5-7) have struggled offensively, ranking 24th in points scored per game (19.7) and 29th in yards per game (308.7). That is unlikely to improve as their best weapon, running back Christian McCaffrey, was placed on injured reserve with an ankle injury. The inefficiency caused Coach Matt Rhule to fire offensive coordinator Joe Brady, who was viewed last off-season as a blossoming head coach candidate. Despite the Panthers’ offensive troubles, Carolina’s defense, which ranks second in fewest yards allowed, should be able to contain the Falcons (5-7), whose offense relies on just three players — receiver Cordarrelle Patterson, tight end Kyle Pitts and quarterback Matt Ryan. Neither of these teams are likely to make the postseason, but in an N.F.C. South rivalry, Carolina should have bragging rights after this one. Pick: Panthers -3 Seattle Seahawks at Houston Texans, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Seahawks -7.5 | Total: 42.5 Why would you watch this game, let alone bet on it? The Seahawks (4-8) have drastically underwhelmed this season and have become one of the worst teams in the league on offense and defense. The Texans (2-10) have been as bad as predicted. Houston’s journeyman quarterback, Tyrod Taylor, was benched for the rookie Davis Mills in a blowout loss to the Colts, and Coach David Culley said he will “evaluate everything” regarding which passer starts for the remainder of the season. The Seahawks, meanwhile, signed the future Hall of Fame running back Adrian Peterson to revive a pedestrian rushing attack, and are motivated to finish the season strong. It’s tempting to take the over, but Houston’s holistic performances have been so poor that Seattle, despite its many offensive deficiencies, should cover. Pick: Seahawks -7.5 Detroit Lions at Denver Broncos, 4:05 p.m., Fox Line: Broncos -8 | Total: 42 The Broncos (6-6) are a quarterback away from truly contending. Teddy Bridgewater can lead the team under ideal circumstances, but in less perfect scenarios his mediocre play is wasting a talented crop of skill-position players and a respectable defense. The Lions (1-10-1), finally won a game last week after having been on the verge of other victories that they squandered with untimely turnovers, bad luck and inexcusable coaching decisions. Detroit has played competitively against teams that are better than Denver, which makes the Lions a safe bet to keep the score within the spread. Pick: Lions +8 Giants at Los Angeles Chargers, 4:05 p.m., Fox Line: Chargers -10 | Total: 45.5 Justin Herbert may be without his top two receivers, Keenan Allen and Mike Williams, because the Chargers (7-5) placed them on the Covid-19 list. The Giants (4-8) may also be short-handed as quarterback Daniel Jones is likely to sit for a second consecutive game with a neck injury. It is unclear whether Mike Glennon, who is in the concussion protocol, or Jake Fromm, whom the Giants recently signed, will start. Regardless, Los Angeles’s defense ranks seventh in fewest passing yards allowed per game (209.5) and should be excited to face either quarterback. Pick: Chargers -10 Chicago Bears at Green Bay Packers, 8:20 p.m., NBC Line: Packers -12.5 | Total: 44 The N.F.L. flexed last week’s Sunday night game and would be wise to do so again. Even with the storied rivalry between the Packers (9-3) and the Bears (4-8), this iteration is unappealing. Chicago’s offense is putrid, scoring the third-fewest points per game (16.8) and ranking 30th in yards per game (298.8). They’ll be outmatched by the Packers, one of the best teams in the league, who could realistically put the game out of reach by halftime. Temperature at kickoff is expected to hover near freezing, but with little chance of snow and no wind expected, there won’t be any impediment to Green Bay’s onslaught, regardless if Andy Dalton starts at quarterback or if Justin Fields (ribs) returns from injury. Pick: Packers -12.5 Los Angeles Rams at Arizona Cardinals, 8:15 p.m., ESPN Line: Cardinals -2.5 | Total: 52 In their Week 4 meeting, the Cardinals (10-2) unknowingly offered the rest of the league an early blueprint to beat the Rams (8-4): Arizona rushed for over 200 yards, forced two turnovers, including an interception, and schemed its offense away from Aaron Donald and Jalen Ramsey. In later weeks San Francisco, Tennessee and Green Bay mimicked that strategy, and the Rams’ new additions, receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and the pass rusher Von Miller, have not been able to change the outcome, putting Los Angeles in jeopardy of a fourth prime-time embarrassment in six weeks. Arizona has shown few weaknesses and looked re-energized with Kyler Murray and DeAndre Hopkins back last week after each missed multiple games. The Rams’ recent performances against strong competition makes them a risky bet, especially on the road. Pick: Cardinals -2.5 Vikings 36, Steelers, 28 We picked the Steelers (6-6-1) to win +3 thinking the Vikings (6-7) would struggle offensively without running back Dalvin Cook and receiver Adam Thielen. We picked wrong. The Vikings won, 36-28, in another thriller — 11 of their 13 games have been decided by one score. Though Thielen sat out with an ankle injury, Cook unexpectedly played just two weeks after dislocating his shoulder. He looked fine and rushed for 205 yards and two touchdowns on 27 carries. Minnesota bursted out to a 23-0 lead at halftime as Pittsburgh struggled on offense and with run defense. Then the Vikings extended their lead to 29-0 with two field goals. But the Steelers crawled back and made it competitive to the last play of the game. Ben Roethlisberger, who was sacked five times, threw for 308 yards and three touchdowns. His last pass of the game was accurately thrown between three defenders to tight end Pat Freiermuth, who would have scored a touchdown and set up a potential game-tying 2-point conversion had he dropped the ball, though safety Harrison Smith had good coverage. Before this week, the Steelers needed to essentially win every game to reach the postseason. Now, their chances are getting slimmer and slimmer. A quick primer for those who are not familiar with betting lines: Favorites are listed next to a negative number that represents how many points they must win by to cover the spread. Raiders -5.5, for example, means that Las Vegas must beat Chicago by at least 6 points for its backers to win their bet. Gamblers can also bet on the total score, or whether the teams’ combined score in the game is over or under a preselected number of points. Advertisement"

Can I Demand That He Get Vaccinated First? - The New York Times,12/9/2021,"Advertisement Supported by Social Q’s A reader asks for permission to make vaccination against Covid-19 a condition of an agreement. Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Philip Galanes My husband and I, both 80-ish, are cautious about Covid. Six months ago, we fired the man who helped us with chores around the house on weekends because he refused to be vaccinated. We discussed our concerns with him, but it was clear that his decision was based on misinformation and that he would not change his mind. Recently we received a text from him asking for a loan to buy a used car. His wife’s car died, so he is forced to drive her to and from work every day. We are thinking of helping him, but only if he gets vaccinated. We recognize this is a kind of blackmail. But would that be so terrible? WIFE Not at all! Lenders put all sorts of conditions on loans to increase the likelihood of their repayment. They often require borrowers, for instance, to insure the cars or other property they buy with borrowed money. Asking your former employee to get vaccinated against Covid-19 is one way to increase the probability of his staying healthy enough to repay you. My concern is that he may reject your direct demand and dig in his heels about the vaccine. He was willing to lose his paying job, after all, to avoid taking the shot. Now, it may be that the inconvenience of ferrying his wife to and from work has changed his calculus. Still, I would suggest a softer approach that gives him more autonomy. Ask him to talk to a mutually agreed-upon expert about the vaccine as the condition for your loan — a provider of medical care, for instance. By expanding his sources of information, you may convince him to want the vaccine. That would be the best result. Not only would he get his loan, you might get your weekend helper back, too. I know of a family that suffered a terrible tragedy: Their son died, leaving their young grandson parentless. The family lives modestly, but I believe their net worth is substantial. (I would guess around $50 to $75 million.) So I was surprised to learn that the family is apparently soliciting donations for a trust fund for the grandchild. This seems almost offensive to me. Am I wrong? ANONYMOUS What an ugly question! First, you assume a family’s great wealth without evidence. (On what do you base your “guess” at their net worth?) You don’t seem to know anything for certain. Then you add that they’re “apparently” soliciting donations. Well, are they, or aren’t they? You don’t even know that. You seem to be trading in idle gossip, none of which affects you personally. Let’s focus on the facts, instead: A family has lost a son, and a young child has lost his father. What possible business is it of yours to speculate on their finances at such a terrible time? If you don’t like the (possibly fictional) trust fund, don’t contribute to it. Because of the pandemic, my husband and I moved temporarily from a city to my suburban hometown. We miss the city, but we’ve decided that staying in the suburbs for the foreseeable future is best for our family. (We recently had a baby, and the family support is amazing — as is the lower cost of living.) The problem: I have always based my identity on living in a city, and my friends look down on the suburbs. I’m afraid they’ll think less of me, and I’ll think less of myself, if I tell them we’re staying here. Help! SOCCER MOM Many readers may quickly assume that you and your friends are pretentious urban snobs. But I get it: Transitions are hard! In your mind, the city is synonymous with youth, vibrancy and culture. (In fact, none of these qualities is exclusive to cities.) Still, it’s taking you a minute to recognize that, as new parents of limited means, you aren’t likely to be out and about (much less club kids) for a long time. Now, the whole point of having friends is to share experiences with them. So, tell yours how you made this decision. Share your ambivalence, too. But don’t forget to mention the things you’re gaining in the bargain: more space, greater affordability and built-in child care. Suddenly, your idea of “cool” pales a bit in comparison, right? I referred a friend who was injured in a slip-and-fall accident to a lawyer friend at a firm that specializes in personal injury lawsuits. My friend ended up getting a good settlement. Would it be appropriate to ask my lawyer friend for a payment for setting up the referral? L.G. In most states, it is illegal for lawyers to pay referral fees to people who are not lawyers. (Creating incentives for ever more lawsuits is bad public policy.) But even absent this rule, helping an injured friend is not the best moment for cashing in. I understand your frustration at watching the gravy train pass you by. Try to focus on your good deed instead.

Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Trish Bendix Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. Here are the 50 best movies on Netflix right now. On Thursday, Fox News hosts continued their insistence that the Christmas tree outside its headquarters had been burned down as part of the war on Christmas. Jimmy Kimmel said the network must not have had anything else to talk about this week, “because they really went to town on this ‘We have been victimized’ jag, and no one did more phony foaming at the mouth than the little dumber boy,” referring to Tucker Carlson. “According to Tucker Carlson, this is not an isolated incident of some disturbed rando lighting their tree on fire,” Stephen Colbert said, even though the police have said the suspect was a homeless man, and that drugs or mental illness could have been a factor in the torching. Seth Meyers imitated Carlson during one of his monologues. “[imitating Carlson] When will it end? Will every new variant mean new powers for our political class? Will they be able to test you, trace you, come to your house and inject you with a microchip hidden in a vaccine that tracks your movements? And will that tracking microchip allow them to see that you went to the anime convention, in secret, of course, because you didn’t want your friends at Fox News to know you’re into that kind of thing. And will they find out about the time you asked Sean Hannity what he thought of ‘Dragon Ball Z,’ and he looked at you like you were crazy, and that hurt your feelings so much that you ran into the bathroom to cry, only to realize you had run into the women’s bathroom and you were so worried that someone would see you run out that you instead removed a ceiling panel and climbed into a heating duct for the purposes of shimmying back to your office, not knowing that the duct wouldn’t be strong enough to support your weight, causing you to, mid-shimmy, collapse through the ceiling, where you landed on top of Rupert Murdoch’s desk while he was sitting at it, causing him to look up from his soup and yell ‘Crikey!’ Will that happen to you? Well, I can tell you it will because it happened to me.” — SETH MEYERS “Oof, that is brutal! And the way she’s sitting like that, and she’s reading it to us, it’s like the world’s most depressing fairy tale: ‘Once upon a time, an ogre crushed the dreams of a princess, and nobody lived happily ever after. The end.’” — TREVOR NOAH “But, yes, Hillary Clinton is giving a master class on resiliency that’s now available everywhere —except in Wisconsin, for some reason.” — TREVOR NOAH “And in it, she reads the victory speech she never got to deliver. And I really love how she’s like, ‘I’ve never shared this speech with anybody before. it was too painful. You’re paying me how much? Oh, well, I guess I could read a few pages.’” — TREVOR NOAH “Wait, why? We don’t want to hear that. You know when we wanted to hear that? After the election in 2016.” — JIMMY KIMMEL “What is this? What is she doing? Is this a Christmas present for Donald Trump?” — JIMMY KIMMEL “It’s like she made him a cameo video for his birthday.” — JIMMY KIMMEL On their Thursday night episode, Desus and Mero tried to convince the actress Sandra Bullock to reboot “Miss Congeniality.” Kelly Clarkson and Bryson Tiller are just two artists with holiday albums redefining the genre.

51,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/09/arts/design/best-art-books.html,Best Art Books of 2021 - The New York Times,12/9/2021,"Advertisement Supported by The art critics of The Times select their favorites from this year’s crop of art books. Send any friend a story As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. By Holland Cotter, Roberta Smith, Jason Farago and Siddhartha Mitter In a lockdown year, with travel reduced, there was no movable feast quite like an art book. Art is made by all sorts of people, everywhere, all the time, along many different paths, some of which are illuminated by these intriguing publications chosen by our critics. The maverick American artist Ray Johnson (1927-1995), who managed to be nowhere and everywhere in the art world through his invention of Mail Art, was lucky in his longtime friend William S. Wilson, to whom, over 60 years, he gave thousands of letters, collages, drawings and clippings. Wilson saved every last scrap, and a jampacked sampling of them makes up this gold mine of a book, edited and curated by Caitlin Haskell with Jordan Carter. Funny, biting, morbid, it’s a page-turner for sure, and accompanies a show at the Art Institute of Chicago through March 22). (Art Institute of Chicago, distributed by Yale University Press) Edited by the curator Valerie Cassel Oliver, this catalog for one of the outstanding exhibitions of the season — originating at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, it’s now in Houston — proposes that the culture of the African American South, as defined by music and vernacular art, is the bedrock of American culture itself, with a strong influence on new art today. The book vividly illustrates and deepens the show’s powerful argument. (Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, distributed by Duke University Press) This book lovingly excavates the career of a Greek modernist painter who designed sets for Maria Callas and kept a Greek Classical figurative tradition alive in paintings of homoerotic nudes. Tsarouchis (1910-1989) was both too radical and too conservative for the art world of his time and fell into oblivion outside of Greece. Edited by Niki Gripari and Adam Szymczyk (and including a selection of the artist’s writings, this tender tribute brings him back. (Sternberg Press) The London exhibition by this name reunited six major mythological paintings that Titian produced for the Spanish court. One of them, “The Rape of Europa,” belongs to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, where the show, now called“Titian: Women, Myth & Power” is making its final stop (through Jan. 2.) A slender Gardner-issued publication devoted to that picture is an indispensable companion volume to the handsome London catalog. (National Gallery, London; published by Yale University Press) Edited by Christine Macel and Karolina Ziebinska-Lewandowska and produced for a major show at the Centre Pompidou, Paris, this book documents the contributions of more than 100 female painters, sculptors, photographers and performers to the history of modernist abstraction and, by including artists from Asia and South America, demonstrates that abstraction itself has always been a global phenomenon. That many worthy figures aren’t included only makes the case for a continuing corrective art history stronger. (Thames and Hudson) Edited by Howie Chen, this compendium brings together archival documents related to the formation, in New York City in 1990, of Godzilla, a collective of artists and curators intent on pointing out the exclusion of Asian American artists from the contemporary art world and pushing for their presence in that world. The book includes protest letters, news releases, and the minutes of group meetings. The result is a how-to in advocacy politics, a study in the complexities of identity politics, and a chorale of treasurable voices. (Primary Information) Following the Guggenheim’s 2018 reveal of the mystical abstractions of Hilma af Klint, the Museum of Modern Art, Kunstmuseum Basel and Tate Modern further expand the mostly male ranks of European modernism to include Sophie Taeuber-Arp, one of its greatest polymaths (and colorists), whose egalitarian view of art and craft proved that abstractions in woven wool can trounce the oil on canvas kind. Edited by Anne Umland and Walburga Krupp. (Museum of Modern Art/Kunstmuseum Basel) The painting on the cover of this exceedingly large volume recently set an auction record for the artist, but don’t let that spoil it for you. This lavish book, edited by Luis-Martín Lozano, contains many rarely seen paintings bolstered by numerous drawings, extensive photographs from her life and reproductions of related works by other artists. (Taschen) This catalog, with a leading essay by the curator Katherine Jentleson, accompanies the largest show of the great visionary Nellie Mae Rowe (1900-1982), painter, sculptor, doll-maker, environment-builder and Christian, at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta (through Jan. 9). Some of her drawings announce “God is Not Dead,” in bold colorful cursive writing. Rowe is the fourth great American outsider artist to receive a major catalog since 2007, after Martin Ramírez, Bill Traylor and Joseph Yoakum. May the trend continue. (DelMonico Books — D.A.P., New York) This small cornucopia of a book, edited by Alison M. Gingeras, accompanies the first American exhibition of the formidable Polish artist and activist Erna Rosenstein (1913-2004) at Hauser & Wirth (through Dec. 23). It shows the stunning variety of her work, not just its many shades of Surrealism and biomorphic abstraction, but also its affinities with Fluxus, Nouveau Realism and Art Povera. Her life and work are detailed against the vivid tapestry of postwar Eastern European history — itself an education. (Hauser & Wirth Publications) Doris Lee (1905-1983) worked simultaneously as a fine and a commercial artist, illustrating “The Rodgers and Hart Songbook,” while exhibiting paintings with the still-extant AAA Galleries in Manhattan. The paintings, which combined Grandma Moses with the textured color fields of Milton Avery cheerfully reflect this duality. This catalog, by Melissa Wolfe, and a traveling show at the Westmoreland Museum of American Art in Greensburg, Pa., (through Jan. 9) should begin to end her obscurity. (Westmoreland Museum of Art and Giles Ltd., London) This year’s unhappy Tokyo Olympics at least leave an architectural legacy: the lean, low-impact New National Stadium, made of the unfinished cedar that Kengo Kuma has made his authorial and ecological signature. This immense architectural tome — spanning three decades, weighing in at 11 pounds — establishes once and for all that sustainability and style need not be set at odds. New photography highlights his serene Nezu Museum and brawny V & A Dundee; temporary experiments in New York and Milan; and a Fukuoka storefront whose 2,000 intersecting cedar struts frame the world’s most elegant Starbucks. (Taschen) He first declared a bicycle wheel to be a work of art in 1913, but it took nearly half a century — with the 1959 publication of Robert Lebel’s catalogue raisonné of his early painting, his ready-mades and his cryptic notes — for the New York art world to crown the discreet and debonair Duchamp as King Marcel. Long out of print, it’s now been re-editioned and bundled with a supplement that maps the influence of Lebel’s book over the decades, all housed in a handsome slipcase. (Hauser & Wirth Publishers) Few photobooks have the mythic status of “Chizu” (“The Map”), first published in Tokyo in 1965, for which the Japanese photographer Kikuji Kawada shot worn flags, dented Lucky Strike boxes and the walls of the Atomic Bomb Dome in Hiroshima as haunted abstractions in blown-out, high-contrast black-and-white. The 1965 edition is a single volume with gatefolds — but a maquette in the New York Public Library shows that Kawada initially conceived “Chizu” as a two-volume project. The N.Y.P.L. curator Joshua Chuang and the historian Miyuki Hinton have overseen this painstaking reproduction, while a new bilingual supplement offers further perspectives on this rarest and most mysterious artistic response to the nightmare of World War II. (Mack) Statues also die; some get a second life. The year’s most beautiful exhibition, at the Capitoline Museums in Rome, brought to public view the world’s finest privately owned Greek and Roman sculptures — and its catalog, edited by the archaeologists Salvatore Settis and Carlo Gasparri, is as handsome as it is learned. But if it’s Roman grandeur you’re after, get the lush coffee table book “Villa Albani Torlonia,” for which Massimo Listri photographed the aristocratic family’s Neoclassical mansion, its chipped goddesses and rusting heroes standing against acres of trompe l’oeil marble and gold leaf. (Both, Rizzoli) The Impressionists were gripped by social life at the opera, the cafe, the seaside; the Nabis, two decades later, saw just as much modernity at home. This catalog of an exhibition at the Cleveland Museum of Art and Portland Art Museum (through Jan. 23) presents the sometimes tender, sometimes stifling domestic imagery of Maurice Denis, Félix Vallotton, Pierre Bonnard and — above all — Édouard Vuillard, whose dense, crosshatched scenes in the boudoir or at the kitchen table captured what one critic called “the daily tragedy and mystery of ordinary existence, and the latent poetry of things.” The curators Mary Weaver Chapin, Heather Lemonedes Brown and other contributors offer insight into domestic music performances, home garden design, and even pet ownership in fin-de-siècle Paris. (Yale University Press) The seventh continent is not frozen but in constant flux — and changing faster than ever thanks to us. Probe the 1,000 engrossing pages of this landmark publication, edited by Giulia Foscari and UNLESS and inaugurated at this year’s Venice Architecture Biennale, and you will learn everything you never knew you needed to know about human society on an uninhabited landmass: Antarctic law enforcement, Antarctic communication technology, Antarctic water management. Terra Australis stands here as a nearly utopian built environment, and the book concludes with an indispensable “Archive of Antarctic Architecture,” with site plans and photography of more than a century’s efforts to inhabit the most extreme of environments. (Lars Müller Publishers) Kara Walker offers an extraordinary tome: some 650 drawings, sketches and texts from her archive since the 1990s. It’s all here — Trump, Obama, the plantation, sexual demand and degradation, all the American phantasmagoria of her famous silhouette works and monumental installations; but also clippings, notecards, dream diaries, the artist wrangling with the fetters of prominence and racial expectations. In an essay, Walker wonders why she kept all this stuff; there must have been “some urge to talk about it later, an urge toward radical openness that any proper and studied artist would prefer to keep in check.” It’s a treasure. (JRP Editions) This volume showcases 17 photographers from nine countries, graduates of a 2008-18 mentorship program founded by Simon Njami, a respected curator (and co-editor of this book, with Sean O’Toole). A few have become recognized — Sammy Baloji, Lebohang Kganye — while others, like Gosette Lubondo, are emerging just now into the continent’s photo vanguard, with a full spectrum of documentary and conceptual approaches. Here, 13 essays by critics approach the subject by theme — “Knowledge,” “Fiction,” “Desire”— and broaden their discussion to other emerging photographers as well as the archive. It’s a generous approach that proposes African photography as a fertile and expansive field of collective inquiry. (Kerber) In an exhibition this year at MoMA, Black architects and designers imagined interventions in 10 American cities that would not only make visible but repair the effects of anti-Black planning, policy and spatial violence. It was an important show, if dense and all-too-brief. Fortunately, the catalog (edited by Sean Anderson and Mabel O. Wilson) supplements these propositions with texts by prominent scholars and critics that give the project an open feel and cross-disciplinary weave. In preparing for the exhibition, the architects and designers formed the Black Reconstruction Collective, modeling the self-determination and liberation values they insist are necessary. (MoMA) Shahzia Sikander is known for disruptions of the Indo-Persian miniature painting tradition, which she expanded compositionally and infused with feminist and political themes. Rich with essays and conversations (edited by Sadia Abbas and Jan Howard), this catalog accompanies an exquisite exhibition on her early career (1987-2003). It follows her training in Pakistan, move to the United States in 1993, and navigation of U.S. social and racial realities; it leaves off in the frenzy of the War on Terror. It proves instructive to re-examine those years through Sikander’s keen grasp and artistic choices. (Distributed for Hirmer Publishers by University of Chicago Press) Advertisement"

                   Also known as Venetians, Neapolitans or tricolore cookies, these classic Italian-American treats are not really cookies at all, but thin, dense layers of brightly hued almond cake stacked with apricot jam, and coated with glossy chocolate. The layers are traditionally red, white and green to resemble the Italian flag, but, of course, you can play around with the colors depending on the holiday and what you have on hand. This version is adapted from Mary Carpino, from Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., who made them every Christmas for years. One of her granddaughters, Nicole Carpino Frasco, passed along the recipe to us.

                   If you weren’t already sure about how easy and delicious braised short ribs can be, consider this classic and straightforward recipe an excellent gateway. The ultimate hands-off, do-ahead dinner, these are done on the stovetop in a large Dutch oven but can easily be adapted to a slow cooker if that’s your thing. When purchasing the ribs, ask for the thickest, meatiest ones available as they tend to shrink quite a bit once braised.

57,https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1893-everyday-pancakes,Everyday Pancakes Recipe - NYT Cooking,,"Andrew Scrivani for The New York Times
                   The basic pancake is made from a simple batter of eggs, flour, milk and baking powder for leavening. You can use different types of flour if you want to experiment with whole wheat or buckwheat. And you can also add fruit to the mixture. The batter can be made from scratch in about the same time it takes to make toast. The most time-consuming part of making pancakes, of course, is cooking them. But that time is so short you should consider these an everyday convenience food, not a special-occasion feast. Cook this recipe a few times and it may become part of your weekly routine.

59,https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/gifts/gifts-we-want-to-give-2021/,The Gifts We Want to Give in 2021 | Reviews by Wirecutter,,"Wirecutter is reader-supported. When you buy through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more. Here at Wirecutter, we take pride in being choosy. And even when we’re off the clock, our standards don’t waver—especially when it comes to holiday gifts for our loved ones. A present must be useful, yes, but also special enough that the recipient will enjoy it long after the Christmas tree is out on the curb or the menorah is tucked away. What follows is a roundup of the fanciest, funniest, and most interesting items to have crossed our consciousness this year (we’ve also included a few choice gifts from New York Times colleagues). These are gifts that we’d love to have ourselves, but more important, that we’d be deeply proud to give. A Bond-esque phone charger and the best bacon are just a few of the delights sure to please the weird and wonderful people in your life. If you’d like even more ideas, check out what we wanted to give in 2020, 2019, 2018, and 2017.  East Fork Everyday Bowl (about $40 at the time of publication) I bought four of these earlier this year, and they remain the absolute most-used bowls we own. Not quite a regular bowl, but certainly not a plate, they’re something a bit in between, perfect for weeknight dinners, scrambled eggs, or a nosh of roasted almonds at a cocktail party. Even leftovers seem elevated in them. Note that if you’re shopping for cereal bowls, these aren’t those (I’m still searching for perfect deep-rimmed Cinnamon Toast Crunch vessels). They’re pricey enough that I’m always on the lookout for a sale to stock up on more—to me, that slight extravagance is a sign that they’d make a great gift. —Jason Chen, deputy editor The White Company Cashmere Bed Socks ($50 at the time of publication) Earlier this year, I wrote about how wearing socks in bed helps me feel warmer and fall asleep faster. At the time, I hadn’t tried The White Company’s Cashmere Bed Socks. Now that I have, I’m sending them as gifts. Their delicate cashmere is of questionable durability, limited use, and ridiculous expense—but if your gift recipient adores pretty pastels, yummy textures, and a loose fit, the wow factor may be priceless. I’ve shopped for cashmere socks in the past, but most are muddy in color and a touch too clingy, designed to be worn with shoes. Conversely, these socks are designed to be worn horizontally, under the covers, to warm your feet without feeling hot. Of course, any slouchy old pair of socks might do, but I’d like to think that these will make my giftees feel a lot more loved. —Joanne Chen, senior staff writer Ototo Gracula Garlic Crusher ($20 at the time of publication) I can think of so many people who would adore this cute Dracula-inspired garlic crusher: the person who loves whimsical kitchen gadgets, the person who loves Halloween year-round, the person who wants to lure kids into the kitchen. Using the Gracula is easy, since you just plop a few cloves into the base (his cape), pop on the top (his head), and twist at the neck for easy mincing. But make sure to remove that chopped garlic quickly—vampires can’t tolerate it for long. —Jessie Mohkami, editorial assistant Oxford Pennant NYC Camp Flag ($60 at the time of publication) Made in downtown Buffalo, New York, Oxford Pennant’s camp flags are great for anyone with a love for nostalgic wool pennants and the wall space to display them. I own and love the screen-printed “NYC” flag—it hangs proudly on the wall of my apartment as a prompt for anyone who’s forgotten their coordinates. And there’s a wide variety of non-geographic designs, too, from the retro to the medieval, the positive to the negative. I also love the collaborations with bands like Wilco and My Chemical Romance. Regardless of your friend’s stylistic (or musical) inclinations, Oxford Pennant’s handsome flags serve as reminders of the important stuff in life. —Justin Krajeski, staff writer Hope Woodworking Leather Fly Swatter ($20 at the time of publication) Spotted lanternflies invaded my New Jersey town about a year ago, and ever since then, we’ve been hunting the destructive, invasive species just fine with a regular old flyswatter. The Hope Woodworking Leather Fly Swatter screamed “perfect gift” because it's the kind of life upgrade one appreciates only after owning it. I can't wait to see my family’s delighted faces when they open their gifts to find these durable, easy-to-clean bug-killing machines. And because I am first and foremost a thrifty shopper, I purchased the three-pack, which gave me a nice discount over buying them individually. —Annemarie Conte, deputy editor Kate McLeod Daily Stone ($45 at the time of publication) Kate McLeod The Routine (about $65 at the time of publication) I live in a desert climate, so I’m constantly thinking about moisturizing. This solid moisturizer “stone” is unlike anything I’ve ever tried. It’s a round disc of cocoa butter and blended oils that you warm between your hands to use. I keep it in its bamboo canister at my desk to hydrate my hands and cuticles throughout the day, but it’s also nice after a shower, smoothed all over the body. The rose, frankincense, and neroli scent is really, really subtle, which I love. The Routine set, which also comes with a dry brush, would make a great gift for anyone this winter. —Daniela Gorny, supervising editor Corkcicle Sling ($45 at the time of publication) Gone are the days of holding my water bottle during long hikes hoping it doesn’t slip from my sweaty hands. I was masterfully targeted by an ad promoting this sling bag and immediately clicked “Add to cart.” It holds a 40-ounce bottle along with my wallet, phone, and keys, so everything stays secure and accessible wherever I go. The convenience is worth every penny. My friends took notice of my handy carrier during a particularly hot day exploring Joshua Tree National Park, and I’ve shared the link a dozen times since. —Rozette Rago, photo editor TravelCard Charger (starting at $30 at the time of publication) Low-battery anxiety is real. If you’ve ever sweated over low-power mode carrying you from 8:00 p.m. through the end of the night, you know what I’m talking about. The obvious solution is a portable power bank. While family and friends have benefited from the Wirecutter-recommended ZMI PowerPack 20000 that I carry around in my backpack, none are willing to tote a similarly sized device themselves. Enter the TravelCard Charger—a $30 credit-card-sized power bank that’s small and cheap enough to stuff into at least a stocking or two. —Cory Hartmann, senior systems analyst, The New York Times Omsom The Best Seller Set ($60 at the time of publication) These premade sauce packs, the brainchild of Vietnamese sisters Vanessa and Kim Pham, have brought so much flavor to my quick weeknight meals. My brother gave me a set of starters last Christmas, and I was blown away by the delicious, layered tastes each packet contained. Recently I loved making a veg-friendly version of bún th<U+1ECB>t nu<U+1EDB>ng (vermicelli bowl) with tofu and Omsom’s Vietnamese Lemongrass BBQ sauce. I’m buying the starter pack of four flavors for anyone trying to throw together a speedy meal after a long day. Grab some protein and veggies, add one of these excellent starters, and you’re ready to go! —Kelsey Dang, senior researcher Boy Smells Broken Rosary Candle ($40 for 8.5 ounces at the time of publication) Boy Smells Future Classics Bundle (about $105 for three candles at the time of publication) There’s something about the holidays that makes me want to have candles—especially the warm and woodsy kind—going 24/7. Boy Smells makes some of our favorite candles, and the Broken Rosary scent is my new favorite. I can’t get enough of the sweet, floral rose with hints of cardamom and cinnamon grounded in sandalwood and moss. Since it’s seasonal, I’m considering stocking up now. Try a gift set bundle or a small votive set if you’re not sure what your giftee may like. —Daniela Gorny, supervising editor Le Labo Ambrette 9 (about $200 for 50 mL at the time of publication) Although I would love for someone to buy this fragrance for me, I’m also all about giving gifts I’d want to receive. Between three sisters and a mom, one lucky recipient will definitely be getting Le Labo’s Ambrette 9, a slightly musky ambrette-seed fragrance that’s made lighter by notes of citrus and fruit. It’s a wonderfully soft and subtle smell that doesn’t overwhelm. If you don’t have the budget for the full-size bottle, the 15 mL mini bottle is a perfect gift. —Sri Rain Stewart, updates writer Kaweco Sport Gel Roller Pens (about $20 at the time of publication) I misplace and break so many pens that a few months ago I found myself asking, “What, o internet, is a durable, attractive, smooth-writing pen that also comes in bright colors?” The answer was unanimous: the Kaweco Sport gel rollerball. I bought a black-ink version with a hot-pink barrel, and it’s a delight. It writes more smoothly than any other pen I’ve used, and I couldn’t break the sturdy plastic barrel if I tried. Best of all, that hot pink is impossible to overlook, even if I’ve carelessly laid the pen down somewhere. There are a few models of the Sport gel rollerball—Skyline, Classic, and Frosted—and it also comes in steel, aluminum, and brass. As with so many things these days, the pens can be in somewhat short supply, but you should be able to find the exact one you want with a little online sleuthing. —Tim Heffernan, senior staff writer How to Survive a Human Attack ($11 at the time of publication) For the horror lover on your list, I cannot recommend my former professor (and current writerly crush) K.E. Flann’s satirical guide How to Survive a Human Attack more highly. Though years of scary-movie consumption have collectively trained people to root for humans, Flann’s book cheekily sides with the monsters, each chapter offering pointers and tricks for their physical and emotional survival. From an anatomical diagram of a human (the stomach is labeled “bacon”) to species-specific advice (like internet-usage tips for a centuries-old vampire), each page of the book drips with whimsy. Especially in a time that can feel just a bit nightmarish, it feels good to laugh about the monstrous with this lighthearted book. —Dorie Chevlen, staff writer Nécessaire The Body Wash ($25 at the time of publication) Nécessaire The Body Essentials ($60 at the time of publication) A good, scented body wash has a way of making even a routine shower feel exceptional and invigorating. The refreshing eucalyptus scent in Nécessaire’s The Body Wash is subtle but lingers in a way that makes me pleasantly anticipate my next spa-like shower. It’s definitely a splurge for a daily body wash, which is why it would make a great gift. It also comes in a nice set with an exfoliator and lotion. —Daniela Gorny, supervising editor Black Food: Stories, Art, and Recipes from Across the African Diaspora (about $30 at the time of publication) As the year ends, I’m drawn to things that help me slow down, embody joy, and look back to look forward. The recently published cookbook Black Food is all of the above. Actually, “cookbook” feels too small. Edited by Bryant Terry, this is an orchestral swell of recipes, poetry, radical caregiving, and essays from across the African diaspora. As an object, it’s stunning. As a kitchen companion, it’s mouthwatering and party-ready (rum raisin plantains foster! jerk chicken ramen! pickled persimmon spears! Champagne cocktail!), complete with a playlist curated for each of the book’s 10 sections. —Katie Okamoto, staff writer Dandelion Chocolate Single-Origin Truffle Collection ($45 at the time of publication) I’m not usually a fan of truffles. They’re either sickly sweet or hiding an unpleasant surprise I didn’t want. Not so with Dandelion Chocolate’s Single-Origin Truffle Collection, a box of 15 chocolates from regions such as Belize, Ecuador, and Madagascar, each with a rich and perfectly unique taste. Beautifully packaged, delicious to eat, and distinctive enough to remain memorable, it’s an easy confection to give. —Kit Dillon, senior staff writer Heath Ceramics Candleholder (about $25 at the time of publication) How simple and chic are these little ceramic candleholders from the mainstay of tasteful wedding registries, San Francisco–based Heath Ceramics? The color is elegant (especially slate), the edges readily catch wax drippings, and the price is right, too. Taper candles are having a moment during these stay-at-home times, but these pieces can hold votives, tea lights, and pillar candles up to 2 inches wide, too, depending on your giftee’s aesthetic. —Jason Chen, deputy editor Neuske’s Smoked Bacon Super Sampler (about $55 at the time of publication) Neuske’s is a family-run Wisconsin-based smokehouse that’s legendary in the Midwest and beyond—and its bacon is especially renowned. Happily, the company ships nationwide for a nominal fee. Most of my gift recipients are meat lovers, so a basket o’ bacon (namely, Neuske’s Smoked Bacon Super Sampler) is an easy crowd-pleaser. You get five varieties—applewood smoked bacon, smoked peppered bacon, triple-thick butcher cut, thin-sliced applewood bacon, and wild cherrywood smoked bacon—weighing 4 pounds in total. —Sarah Witman, staff writer Cody Foster Vintage-Inspired Food Ornaments (starting at $16 at the time of publication) With 29 options such as charcuterie, waffles, and a straight-up stick of butter, these delightful food ornaments from Cody Foster and Food52 have something for everyone. The cheeky attention to detail (oysters on crushed ice with lemon! fully marbled bacon!) lend the ornaments a whimsical appeal, and although I don’t celebrate Christmas, I’d happily display them year-round in my kitchen. They’re affordable enough to send to friends, too. I’m looking forward to matching my loved ones to their fave snacks, drinks, and treats. —Anna Perling, staff writer Rancho Gordo Royal Corona Beans ($8 for 1 pound at the time of publication) I just bought 10 pounds of these beans, and though I’ll admittedly be keeping a few for myself, I’m so excited to wrap 1-pound portions with a pretty ribbon and give them to all my foodiest friends. Rancho Gordo grows and sources heirloom beans from its farm in Napa, California, and these creamy, giant, white versions with a timely name are some of the best. I’ll be preparing them as pizza beans, in classic Minestrone, or in any of the white-bean recipes in my new favorite cookbook, The Weekday Vegetarians. For anyone on the to-gift-or-not-to-gift list in your life, a bag of bespoke beans is a great option: inexpensive, rare, and absolutely delicious. —Hannah Morrill, editor Courant Catch 3 Essentials ($100 at the time of publication) If your gift recipient wants (or needs) an elegant catchall to store things that don’t really have a permanent resting place (sunglasses, AirPods, bracelets, lip balm, keys), this Courant tray offers an old-school vibe without looking too Mad Men. I wasn’t really looking for a device that could also charge my phone wirelessly (and, anyway, there are plenty of great dedicated versions of those if you’re interested), but I appreciate that this one does—and also handsomely displays the stuff jamming up my pockets. I can think of so many people who would appreciate this handy upgrade. —Jason Chen, deputy editor Kinstler Puzzles (about $35 at the time of publication) Because it’s boring to keep assembling “Starry Night,” my friend Rami Metal started Kinstler, a puzzle company featuring emerging and contemporary artists. The resulting puzzles are great—1,000 pieces showcasing work from artists such as Rusudan Khizanishvili and Andrea Joyce Heimer—and as a bonus, each box features a Q and A with the artist, too. (Good luck getting Van Gogh to sit for an interview.) If you have a puzzler on your list, it’s hard to find an original gift. This is it. —Taffy Brodesser-Akner, staff writer, The New York Times Magazine Colored Aura Flower Fairy Crystroll ($155 at the time of publication) Last year, I wrote about these perfectly bizarre troll dolls, and I really thought that one of my many (alleged!) loved ones would have bought one for me by now. And yet, hope springs eternal. If I don’t get this little guy come Hanukkah, I will just buy one myself. There’s no denying they’re strange, smiling under their crystal crowns, their chubby tummies adorned with belly-button jewels. But I am strange, too. And so I want one. Whatever is, is right. —Dorie Chevlen, staff writer Dorie Chevlen Dorie Chevlen is a staff writer from Youngstown, Ohio, now living in Los Angeles.

Published December 8, 2021 Lauren Dragan Share this post When Apple ditched the headphone jack on its iPhones in 2016, I was annoyed. Don’t get me wrong—my wireless Bluetooth earbuds, with their breezy untethered liberation, will always have a place in my heart for jogging, working, and puttering about the house. But I deeply resent the need to fish out that 3.5 mm–to–Lightning adapter because I still love my wired headphones, too.  I’m not alone in my affection—wired earbuds are cool again. I see the appeal. Wired headphones are as timeless and uncomplicated as your favorite sweater. Wired earbuds don’t need to be charged, they sound better for the money, they’re more environmentally friendly, and they usually last longer. TikTok creators like them for their portable in-line directional microphones that require zero setup. Plus, nothing says “I’m busy” like a cable hanging from your ears (which is partly why I suspect they’ve become popular on what Teen Vogue calls “hot girl walks”). Using wired earbuds is the rare trend that is both a rejection of the status quo and a (mostly) less expensive option. But if you, like me, have painful memories of money wasted on ill-advised fads that were not a good match long-term (I’m looking at you, velour tracksuits), you might hesitate to get “committed to the wire,” as Shelby Hull, creator of the Instagram account Wired It Girls, put it in an interview with Teen Vogue. Fortunately, I’ve tested a lot of headphones, so let me reassure you: Whether it’s for sustainable, practical, or fashionable reasons, you can get some seriously great earbuds that you won’t regret purchasing, even if trends change. Fit is of utmost importance. Not only does the fit affect the comfort of your earbuds, but it also can affect how they sound. In our testing, we look for earbuds that come with a variety of tip sizes and fit all of our panelists well, although no single earbud will fit every person. If you find the included tip options uncomfortable, try replacement tips before spending the money on new earbuds. Sometimes a pair of tips with a different material or shape that better suits your anatomy can make all the difference. A remote with at least a single button and microphone is key for day-to-day use if you want to take calls and record videos. We test our picks to confirm that they work well, without crackling, muffling, or distorting the user’s voice. If you usually hold a microphone up to your mouth to record a video, be sure to aim the mic at your face from about 4 inches away and off to one side. This avoids proximity effect (that weird muffled or distorted quality) and popping (the sound the mic makes when you say “b,” “p,” and other plosive sounds that blow air at the microphone) while still reducing room and background noise. The earbuds should sound good! The entire point of headphones is to enjoy what you’re listening to. For example, the bassline shouldn’t overpower the lead guitar, and the vocals shouldn’t have consonants that are painfully, piercingly loud. Bass notes should have pitch and form—they shouldn’t just sound like “whump whump whump.” Rapid successions of notes should be individually audible and shouldn’t smear together. Good earbuds should be built to last a few years. And the company that makes the headphones should be reputable. In a perfect world, nothing ever goes wrong, but if it does here in the real world, you deserve solid customer service that will take care of your needs. Your earbuds should work with your primary music sources. Although it may be easier to use a set of Lightning-cable earbuds with your iPhone or iPad, that pair of headphones won’t work with anything else. And although there are adapters that convert 3.5 mm into Lightning—even some that allow for both listening and charging—you won’t find any input Lightning to 3.5 mm output adapters. Having a device-specific earbud is annoying if you want to switch to a laptop or another OS entirely. The most universal connector is 3.5 mm, followed by USB-C. I tether my adapter to my 3.5 mm earbuds with a hair tie when I’m using it, and I keep it in a little keychain pill container with my earplugs when I’m not using it. You can find a lot of truly amazing-sounding earbuds (or in-ear monitors, as the audiophile set calls them), so as with any audio devices, you definitely have ways to upgrade should you want to go all-in on the wired life. But for a first pair, we recommend something affordable that suits your lifestyle. You can read more in our guide to wired earbuds. The RP-TCM125 ErgoFit wired earbuds sound quite good for their super-affordable price, and they come with an optional single-button remote and microphone. If you want to spend the absolute least amount possible and still get quality sound, you can’t beat the Panasonic RP-TCM125 ErgoFit wired earbuds. The RP-TCM125 pair has a nice balanced sound, with airy, mellow highs and present but not dominating bass. Every sonic frequency plays well with the others, so this pair sounds just as good with acoustic guitar as it does with hip-hop and rock music—which is uncommon among competitors in the sub-$30 price range. This set doesn’t have the depth of field (the sense that music emanates from performers located at various positions in a given space, rather than a flat wall of sound) or bass quality of the Marshall Mode pair (which you can read about below), but for the price, the RP-TCM125 set is still great. The earbuds have an optional single-button remote/mic on the cable, and they come in a variety of colors. The Marshall Mode earbuds sound wonderfully rich and balanced. The fit is secure and comfortable, and the cable has a single-button universal remote. *At the time of publishing, the price was $60. The Marshall Mode set has a smooth sound profile that can handle any style of music, but it especially suits rock and pop. Bass frequencies are slightly boosted, yet there is no thudding or blurriness in the bass notes, and high frequencies are clear without the harshness that affects many earbuds priced under $100. The earbuds themselves are comfortable and low-profile, so they don’t stick out or dangle annoyingly from your ear canals. The single-button universal remote on the cable handles playback and digital-assistant activation, and the separate microphone sits higher up on the cable so you don’t have to hold it up to your mouth when you talk. The EM205 is a rare affordable pair with volume buttons, great sound, and an option with a USB-C cable. If you want an affordable wired pair with a three-button remote and mic, the Strauss & Wagner EM205 set is pricier than the Panasonic RP-TCM125 ErgoFit but has track and volume controls that function with most devices that have headphone jacks. The sound and microphone quality is as good as that of the Panasonic pair but has slightly boosted bass and a little extra spike in the highs; this effect can give strings a metallic edge and can make piano-key depressions sound a bit clicky. Although these earbuds sound very good, they don’t produce an improvement that’s significant enough to warrant the extra money in comparison with the $15 Panasonic pair, nor does this set offer the sense of space that the Marshall pair provides. (For folks who need a USB-C connector rather than a 3.5 mm jack, Strauss & Wagner also makes the EM8C, but that pair costs around $10 more.) One caveat: Strauss & Wagner is a newer company, so it doesn’t have a customer service track record. But with earbuds under $50, that may not be a factor for many folks. by Daniel Varghese and Adrienne Maxwell If you want to use your favorite wired headphones over a wireless connection, the easy-to-use FiiO µBTR is the best Bluetooth headphone adapter we’ve tested. by Lauren Dragan We’ve tested several hundred headphones, including wireless, noise-cancelling, and even kids headphones, to pick the best headphones in each category. by Lauren Dragan If you’re looking for backup headphones or just don’t want to spend a lot, we reviewed all the best cheap headphones for you. by Lauren Dragan Whether you’re looking for the best sound or just to cancel out the noise, we’ve picked the best headphones for anyone who wants an immersive experience.

When you buy through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more. FYI  We’ve updated this overview with the most current info from our various projector guides, and we’ve added a What to look forward to section with new projectors we’re currently testing or considering.  December 8, 2021 Different projectors are designed for different uses, and they can range in price from a couple hundred dollars to well into the five-figure range. Choosing the right model for your needs can be a daunting task, and we’re here to help. Below is an overview of the top picks from our various projector guides. We have recommendations for premium 4K movie projectors, bright living-room projectors, budget home theater projectors, and more. 
If you’re not sure where to begin your projector search, we recommend reading about how to pick the right projector for your viewing needs. In summary, you have three important questions to ask at the start: What do you plan to use the projector for? What type of room will you use it in? How big of a screen do you want? There’s a huge difference in price and performance between a 4K projector designed for a big-screen home theater and a portable mini projector designed to be an everyday TV replacement. Some projectors excel with movies in a completely dark room, while others are better for sports or gaming in a room with some ambient light. Generally, the bigger the screen you want, the brighter your projector must be to produce a satisfyingly rich image. Once you have a general idea of the projector’s intended use, it’s easier to zero in on a specific choice. The JVC DLA-NX5 produced the best overall image of the 4K home theater projectors we tested. If you want to set up a dedicated home theater in a basement or spare room and need a projector that can handle high dynamic range and wide-color-gamut material, choose the JVC DLA-NX5. This model provides the best combination of high contrast, high dynamic range, rich colors, and increased detail. But to fully appreciate the contrast and black-level improvements that this projector offers, you need to use it in a completely dark room. Read more about the JVC DLA-NX5 in our guide to the best 4K projector. The BenQ HT2050A has the best contrast ratio in its price class, as well as realistic color, great detail, and a robust connection panel. With delayed shipping (arrives late Dec) If you don’t want to spend a ton of money but still need a projector that produces a bright, colorful image and works well for both dedicated rooms and those with some ambient light, our pick offers the best combination of performance and value for most people. The BenQ HT2050A offers better contrast, color, and brightness than any projector in its class. Read more about this pick and others in our guide to the best budget projector for a home theater. This projector combines high brightness with accurate color, great contrast, and good setup tools to fit in a variety of rooms. May be out of stock May be out of stock The Epson Home Cinema 3800 projector offers a clear step up in picture quality over budget 1080p projectors, and its native contrast ratio—the difference between the darkest and brightest parts of an image—is much higher than that of most projectors around the same price. It can’t compete with the best 4K home theater projectors in overall performance, but its high brightness makes it a better choice for use in a living room or family room where you can’t block out all the light. You can read more about this projector and others in our full guide to living-room projectors. The MoGo Pro is a portable 1080p projector and Android TV streaming media player in one small, battery-powered package. If you need a small, compact projector you can easily put away, or even carry around with you in a backpack, a portable projector might be your best fit. The Xgimi MoGo Pro offers almost everything we could ask for in a portable movie projector. It delivers a good-looking image with better contrast and detail (and more picture adjustments) than most of its competitors. It’s easy to set up and use, it’s compact, and it has an internal battery. Best of all, it has Android TV with Chromecast and Google Assistant built in, so it’s basically a projector and full-fledged streaming media player in one. You can read more about this projector and others in our full guide to portable mini projectors. If you’re short on space, the BenQ HT2150ST can produce a larger image from a shorter distance. *At the time of publishing, the price was $895. In order to create a large image most projectors need to be positioned far from the screen. This distance is called the throw distance, and can be anywhere from 8 to 15 feet, depending on the projector and desired image size. Short-throw projectors are convenient for small rooms or other situations where space is limited. The BenQ HT2150ST can sit much closer to the screen than a standard projector, and is bright enough to use in a room with some ambient light. You can read more about this projector in our guide to the best budget projector for a home theater. The GS2 is one of the brightest and most accurate portable projectors we’ve tested, and the more durable, weatherproof design makes it a good outdoor projector. You save $100 (17%) If you’re looking for something more rugged to use outside, the BenQ GS2 is battery-powered and both splash and drop resistant, so it’s a good choice for camping or enjoying a backyard movie night when mated with a modest-size screen. It doesn’t perform as well as our indoor portable pick for movies, and it’s not as bright as a bulb-based, non-battery-powered home theater projector, but the picture is certainly good enough for casual TV watching or the occasional outdoor viewing session. You can read more about this projector and others in our full guide to portable mini projectors. This inexpensive screen offers performance comparable to that of others costing much more, plus it’s easy to install. If you have a projector, you should get a screen. Most modern projectors are bright enough to throw a decent image on just about any close-enough-to-white surface, but you won’t get accurate colors without a proper screen. A screen has less texture than a wall, plus it will add pop to the image, because paint almost always has less gain (that is, it reflects less light) than a screen, meaning the image will appear dimmer than is ideal. The Silver Ticket 100"" performs as well as screens costing thousands of dollars. You can read about screen materials and our testing methods in our full guide to the best projector screen. If you’re putting together a backyard theater, consider one of our outdoor screen recommendations. This is the closest thing to the perfect projector mount we’ve used. If you want to get your projector up and out of the way, you need a mount. The Peerless-AV PRGS-UNV Projector Mount is one of our favorites due to its flexibility and how easy it is to set up correctly. The mounting arms are highly adjustable and removable, so it can handle anything from a tiny DLP projector to the gigantic JVC D-ILA projectors that most mounts cannot fit. The dials let you easily make small adjustments to the projector to get it level with the screen and produce the best-quality image without much work. After years of using this mount and going through dozens of tested projectors, we have yet to find one that the Peerless-AV cannot handle. You’ll probably need some speakers, AV sources, and other accessories. Check out our recommendations in “The Best Gear for Building Your Home Theater.” Here’s a look at some of the new projectors we’re considering for our various guides: Best 4K Projector: The Sony VPL-VW325ES replaces the VPL-VW295ES that we tested in the past and increases the price to $5,500. Sony added its X1 processor to this projector, and we’ve liked the performance of that processor in the company’s TVs. The VW325ES has a claimed light output of 1,500 lumens, which is 300 lumens less than the JVC DLA-NX5, and the Sony lacks the dynamic iris that the JVC offers.  JVC announced new 4K projectors that are among the very first to support HDMI 2.1. The JVC DLA-NZ7, DLA-NZ8, and DLA-NZ9 use a laser light engine that offers 20,000 hours of life, improved contrast ratios, and higher light output than before. These projectors can display content at 4K 120 Hz, making them able to fully handle the most recent game consoles and PCs. They all have a native 4K resolution and feature 8K e-Shift to offer upscaling to an 8K resolution. The $10,000 DLA-NZ7 is the least expensive model, and we may test it as an upgrade pick to the DLA-NX5. LG has released the $3,000 HU810PW 4K projector that uses a DLP light engine and dual lasers (red and blue), which allows it to cover almost the entire DCI color gamut while still having a claimed 2,700 lumens of brightness and 20,000 hours of life. The HDMI inputs also support HDMI 2.1 features like automatic low-latency mode and eARC, but not higher refresh rates from gaming consoles.  Best Home Projector for a Living Room: We’re currently researching and calling in a group of premium ultra-short-throw projection systems, which their makers position as big-screen replacements for a living-room TV. Our list includes the Optoma CinemaX P2, BenQ V7050i, LG HU85LA, Samsung Premiere line, and Epson EpiqVision line. Optoma’s new UHZ50 is a 4K HDR DLP projector that uses a laser light source to produce a claimed brightness of 3,000 ANSI lumens. Setup features include a 1.3x zoom and vertical lens shifting. It has three HDMI ports (including one that supports eARC) and two USB ports, plus a 240 Hz refresh rate and low input lag for gaming. Its estimated street price of $2,800 is a good bit higher than our picks, but we plan to test it as a possible upgrade option. Best Budget Projector for a Home Theater: LG has added a new sub-$1,000 1080p projector to its CineBeam line. The PF610P is a DLP projector that uses an LED light source instead of a traditional bulb and has a claimed brightness of 1,000 ANSI lumens. It has a smaller form and shorter throw ratio than many traditional projectors, and includes LG’s WebOS smart-TV platform, as well as Bluetooth audio output and AirPlay 2 and Miracast support to receive streamed content from mobile devices. Best Portable Mini Projector for Movies: Xgimi has launched the Halo+, which like the MoGo Pro and original Halo is a battery-powered 1080p projector with Android TV—but the Halo+ has a higher claimed brightness of 900 ANSI lumens, a more advanced suite of automatic picture adjustments, faster startup times, and an $859 price tag. We plan to test this one as a possible upgrade pick. BenQ's new $800 GS50 is a step up in specs and price from our outdoor pick, the GS2. The new model has the same brightness rating as the GS2 and is similarly portable and weatherproof. But it ups the resolution to 1080p, makes the switch to Android TV, and adds a woofer for improved audio quality. BenQ also introduced the smaller $600 GV30, which has a 720p resolution and Android TV but is only rated at 300 ANSI lumens of brightness.

When you buy through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more. Even seasoned cooks can scorch a pan, whether they’re searing meat at high temperatures or fiddling with a delicate sauce. And if you have the right gear, cleaning those tough stains isn’t as much of a pain as it would seem. Based on our years of experience cooking at home and in professional kitchens, here are the techniques we use to keep our cookware gleaming.  Spatula or paper towels: Use a spatula or paper towels to get rid of excess oil. Dish brush: We like to use a long-handled dish brush, such as the OXO Good Grips Dish Brush, to loosen any bits of stuck-on food. Scouring pad or sponge: A fresh Scotch-Brite scouring pad or sponge will be the most effective at removing stains. A softer Dobie pad will require more effort but will leave fewer scratches. Dish soap: We recommend the unscented Seventh Generation Natural Dish Liquid. Towel: Dry off pans before putting them away. Baking soda: Baking soda or other powdered cleaners are abrasive enough to scrub off stains without damaging pans. Towel or oven mitts: You’ll want to clean your pan while it’s hot, so protect your hands with a towel or an oven mitt. Toothpicks: To get into the nooks and crannies of a pan’s rivets, you can pry off gunk with a toothpick. Large pot, like a stock pot or roasting pan: If you want to boil your scorched pans in water and baking soda to remove years of grime, you’ll need to find a vessel large enough to hold them. We recommend a big stock pot or a roasting pan. To clean most pans after cooking in them, you’ll likely need less than five minutes to wipe them out, scrub them down, and dry them off. But removing tough stains can take longer. Whether you’re using elbow grease to scrub or boiling baking soda and water in your pans, it can take 15 to 30 minutes or more. In some cases, you may want to leave a baking soda slurry on stains overnight before washing it off the next day. To clean a pan that you’ve just used, first scrape out excess oil with a spatula, or wipe it out with a paper towel. Then deglaze the pan by adding some hot water. Cleaning a hot pan is easier, and adding hot water won’t damage it. But always let your pan cool down before fully submerging it in cool water. Otherwise the sudden change in temperature (called thermal shock) can cause a still-hot pan to warp. You can loosen any fond (the browned bits of food) with a long-handled dish brush—we like the OXO Good Grips Dish Brush, which we’ve used in our test kitchen for years. Grab a green Scotch-Brite scouring pad or sponge, along with some dish soap, and scrub the inside and outside of the pan, using a continuous circular motion. A Scotch-Brite pad will lightly scratch the surface of the pan. But as long as you avoid harsh pads (such as steel wool), it won’t affect your cookware’s performance or lifespan. A softer sponge, like a Dobie pad, won’t leave scratches, but using one requires more elbow grease. And it won’t save your cookware from getting marked up by metal cooking utensils anyway. Rinse and then dry with a clean, absorbent towel. If dish soap and scrubbing aren’t cutting it, to remove cooked-on oil or burnt food, create a slurry of water and baking soda (or another powdered cleaner) in the bottom of the pan. Be generous with the baking soda. Let the mixture sit for a few minutes, and then scrub it off with a scouring pad—preferably a new one with a fresh, unworn scrubby side. If the stains won’t come off, you can repeat these steps and let the paste sit for longer (even overnight). For bigger, tougher stains that climb up the sides of a saucepan or skillet, Geri Porter, the longtime kitchen manager for Martha Stewart, suggested the following method: Add a small mound of baking soda to the center of a pan, cover with about ¼ cup water (you might need more for a bigger pan), and bring to a boil. As the water boils and evaporates, it will leave a film of baking soda around the walls of the pan that you can then scrub off. When most of the water has boiled off, turn off the heat. Then use a long-handled brush or scouring pad to scrub off your mess (again, new pads will work better). It’s best to do this while the pan is still hot, so it may help to use gloves and grip the pan with a towel or oven mitt. We’ve had success with this method for freshly scorched pans, but it isn’t as effective for boiling off years of grime. Wirecutter senior staff writer Michael Sullivan has a special method for banishing years of built-up scorch marks. He fully submerges his dingiest pans in a pot of boiling water and baking soda to boil off the stains. Although it’s a little awkward to wrangle a large metal object from a pot of steaming water, the results are magical. Choose a vessel that will fit your pan, like a large stock pot for small skillets or a roasting pan for larger ones. Then fill it with enough water to submerge (or mostly submerge) your pan, and bring it to a boil. If you’re using a large roasting pan, you can arrange it over two burners on the stovetop. Add a hearty pour of baking soda (about ¼ cup or ½ cup), and then carefully place your pan in the water. Reduce the water to a gentle boil, and let the pan cook for about 15 to 30 minutes, flipping or rotating it if necessary, so that all the sides are boiled. You should start to see brown residue flaking off. Using tongs and silicone oven mitts, remove the pans carefully. Then, to create an abrasive slurry to help break down the rest of the stains, add more baking soda and water to the pan, and scrub quickly while the pan is hot. You can hold on to the pan with a towel. To truly scrape off every last bit of gunk, go at the rivets with a toothpick or a cheap paring knife.

If you are not logged in, or do not have an account with any Times Services listed above, your opt-out of the “sale” of personal information will be specific to the browser or device from which you have clicked “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” and until you clear your cookies (or local storage in apps) on this browser or device.   If your browser or device is using a “do not track” setting, we will detect it and honor it on that specific browser or device only. If you wish to have a “do not track” experience across all of your browsers and devices, please make sure that all of your browsers and devices are set on “do not track.”   After you opt out of the “sale” of your personal information, we will no longer “sell” your personal information to third parties (except in an aggregated or de-identified manner so it is no longer personal information), but we will continue to share your personal information with our service providers, which process it on our behalf. Exercising your right to opt out of the “sale” of your personal information does not mean that you will stop seeing ads on our sites and apps.   To opt-out of interest-based advertising as much as technically possible, go to “How Do I Manage Trackers” in our Cookie Policy. To opt out of the “sale” of your personal information from participating companies, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance website or apps. We do not control these opt-out mechanisms and are not responsible for their operation.   You can designate someone else to make a request on your behalf. To protect your information, we will ask for a signed permission from you authorizing the other person to submit a request on your behalf. We will contact you to verify your identity before we respond to your authorized agent’s request.   After 12 months, we may ask you if you want to opt into the “sale” of your personal information.   For further information, please refer to our Privacy Policy.   The New York Times Company does not sell personal information of its readers as the term “sell” is traditionally understood. But “sell” under the CCPA is broadly defined. It includes the sharing of personal information with third parties in exchange for something of value, even if no money changes hands. For example, sharing an advertising or device identifier to a third party may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA.   To the extent The New York Times Company “sells” your personal information (as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA), you have the right to opt-out of that “sale” on a going-forward basis at any time.
